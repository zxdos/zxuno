== Introduction

ZXDOS+ and gomaDOS+ are the continuation of https://zxuno.speccy.org[ZX-Uno] a hardware and software project based on an FPGA board programmed to work like a ZX Spectrum computer, and created by the ZX-Uno team: Superfo, AVillena, McLeod, Quest and Hark0.

Over time, the project has been growing, and now it is possible to install different software configurations (cores) in the flash memory of the FPGA, which work like different systems than the ZX Spectrum, and you can choose to start the ZXDOS+ with the desired configuration among all those installed.

ZXDOS+ and gomaDOS+ official web page is https://zxdos.forofpga.es.

Most of the functions and features of ZXDOS+ and gomaDOS+ are the same, so this document will generally talk about ZXDOS+, indicating the differences with gomaDOS+ where necessary.

=== Aknowledgements

A lot of the content of this manual is based on information previously shared:

- At https://www.forofpga.es/[foroFPGA]
- At https://www.zxuno.com/forum/[ZX-Uno forum]
- Several existing FAQ, mostly the original version https://uto.speccy.org/zxunofaq.html[by @uto_dev], and the latest one http://desubikado.sytes.net/zx-uno-faq-version-desubikado/[by @desUBIKado]

Without the previous work of all of these people (and more), this manual wouldn't exist.

=== Initial Setup

In order to be able to set up and use a ZXDOS+ or gomaDOS+ you need, at least, the following:

- A USB charger or a TV or other device that offers USB power
- VGA cable and monitor
- PS/2 keyboard (in the case of ZXDOS +)

In order to take advantage of its full potential, you may also have:

- A microSD card, not necessarily very large
- PC speakers to connect to the audio output, or a stereo jack converter to two red/white RCA connectors to connect to the TV (this is optional on gomaDOS+, as it has a beeper inside)
- A standard Atari joystick, such as a Megadrive DB9 gamepad (gomadOS+ needs a joystick adapter)
- A PS/2 mouse (USB to PS/2 adapter is needed when using a gomaDOS+)
- An audio cable with a stereo 3.5 mm jack on one side, and both audio channels split into two mono outputs on the other side, if you want to use an audio player and/or recorder, like, for example, a Miniduino (<<#_miniduino,see more info later>>)., a PC/Mac/Raspberry PI, etc. or a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape[cassette tape] recorder/player. The right sound channel is used as input (EAR) and the left channel can be used as output (MIC).

==== microSD card formatting

In order to use a microSD card, it has to be formatted with, at least, one FAT16 or FAT32 format (depending on the case, one or the other format is recommended for compatibility with different third-party cores). It must be the first partition if there are more than one, except for the Spectrum core wich can have <<#_microsd_advanced_format_3e,the first partition in +3DOS format, and then the second one in FAT16 or FAT32 format>> to use with a +3e ROM.

[NOTE]
====
FAT16 partitions have a maximum size of 4GB
====

[CAUTION]
====
When naming a partition which will be used with esxdos, it's important not to use the same of any directory inside, or an access error will happen when trying to see the contents (e.g. do not name the partition as `BIN`, `SYS` or `TMP`).
====

===== Windows

For simple configurations, and cards of the correct size (less than 2GB for FAT16 or less than 32GB for FAT32), you can use https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/[the official formatting tool of the SD Association ].

For other, more complex, configurations, and depending on operating system version, you may use the command line tool `diskpart` or Windows Disk Managemente GUI.

===== MacOS

For simple configurations, and cards of the correct size (less than 2GB for FAT16 or less than 32GB for FAT32), you can use https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/[the official formatting tool of the SD Association ] or Disk Utility, which is included with the operating system.

In other case, you should use the command line.

For example, to format a card, shown as `disk6`, with only one FAT16 partition (if the card size is less than 2GB):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR "MS-DOS FAT16" ZXDOSPLUS R
----

To split it into two FAT16 partitions of the same size (if the card size is 4GB or less):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR "MS-DOS FAT16" ZXDOSPLUS 50% "MS-DOS FAT16" EXTRA 50%
----

To create two FAT 16 partitions (e.g. to use MSX core) and have the rest of space as another FAT32 partition (for cards more than 8GB in size):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR %DOS_FAT_16% ZXDOSPLUS 4G %DOS_FAT_16% EXTRA 4G "MS-DOS FAT32" DATA R
sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 -v ZXDOSPLUS -c 128 /dev/rdisk6s1
sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 -v EXTRA -b 4096 -c 128 /dev/rdisk6s2
----

[NOTE]
====
`diskutil` cannot create FAT16 partitions which are bigger than 2G and also format them. That's why, in this example, after only creating the partitions, we have to format them.
====

To create one FAT32 4GB partition (e.g. to use with Amstrad CPC 6128 core), and then have the rest of space available as a second FAT32 partition (for cards of more than 4GB):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR "MS-DOS FAT32" ZXDOSPLUS 4G "MS-DOS FAT32" EXTRA R
----

<<<

===== Linux

There are a lot of tools for Linux that can format and/or partition a microSD card (`fdisk`, `parted`, `cfdisk`, `sfdisk` or `GParted` to name a few). It should only be taken into account that the partition scheme must always be MBR, and the first partition (the one that will be used for esxdos) must be primary partition.

<<<

==== esxdos

https://esxdos.org/index.html[esxdos] is a firmware for the DivIDE/DivMMC hardware interfaces (which ZXDOS+ implements). This allows access to storage devices such as a microSD card. It includes commands similar to those of UNIX, although to use them you must precede them with a period, for example `.ls`,` .cd`, `.mv`, etc.

For it to work, it is necessary to include the corresponding files in the first partition of the microSD card.

At the time of writing this document, the version included with ZXDOS+ is 0.8.6, and it can be downloaded from the official website https://www.esxdos.org/files/esxdos086.zip[at this link].

Once downloaded and extracted, you have to copy the directories `BIN`, `SYS` and `TMP`, and all of their content, to the root of first partition of the microSD card. 

If everything has been done correctly, when you turn on the ZXDOS+ Spectrum core, you will see how esxdos detects the card and loads the necessary components to work.

[.text-center] 
image:./img/esxdos.png[pdfwidth=70%]

<<<

It is also recommended to add the specific esxdos commands for ZXDOS+. These can be obtained from the project source page (https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/SD[here], https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/[here] and https://guest:zxuno@svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/software/upgrade[here]), and are as follows:

    back16m
    backzx2
    backzxd
    corebios
    dmaplayw
    esprst
    iwconfig
    joyconf
    keymap
    loadpzx
    playmid
    playrmov
    romsback
    romsupgr
    upgr16m
    upgrzx2
    upgrzxd
    zxuc
    zxunocfg

<<#_zxdos+_commands,It is explained later> what each of them does.

=== GomaDOS+ keyboard modes

gomaDOS+ keyboard, being similar to the original ZX Spectrum keyboard, lacks some of the existing keys on a modern PC keyboard. The keyboard membrane is connected to an Arduino board, which manages the transformation key presses to PS/2 keyboard protocol. The board is programmed so it can behave in different modes according to your needs.

The default is ZX Spectrum mode. To change to a different mode, you must press `Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+U` and then the key for the desired mode. After doing that, some text is automatically typed, to show the selected mode (for example `.zx` if you press `Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+U` and then `0`).

This table shows the available modes and activation keys:

=== BIOS

Pressing the `F2` key (`Caps Shift+1` on gomaDOS+) during boot will access the BIOS setup. The BIOS firmware is the first program that runs when the ZXDOS+ is turned on. The main purpose of BIOS is to start and test the hardware and load one of the installed cores.

Using left and right cursor keys (`Caps Shift+5` and `Caps Shift+8` on gomaDOS+), you can navigate through the BIOS setup screens. With up and down keys (`Caps Shift+7` and `Caps Shift+6` on gomaDOS+) you can choose the different elements of each screen and, with the `Enter` key, it is possible to activate and choose the options for each of these. `Esc` key (`Caps Shift+Space` on gomaDOS+) is used to close open option windows without applying any action.

==== Main

[.text-center] 
image:img/bios.png[pdfwidth=70%]

In the first configuration screen, in addition to being able to run several tests, you can define the default behavior for the following:

- Boot Timer: Sets how long the boot screen is available (or hiding it completely)
- Check CRC: Check ROM integrity when loading (more secure) or bypassing it (faster)
- Keyboard
- Timing: ULA Behaviour (48K, 128K, Pentagon Modes)
- Contended
- DivMMC
- DivMMC NMI Support
- New Graphic Modes Support (ULAPlus, Timex, Radastan)

More technical information can be found on https://www.zxuno.com/wiki/index.php/ZX_Spectrum[de ZX-Uno Wiki].

==== ROMs

[.text-center] 
image:img/bios2.png[pdfwidth=70%]

The second screen shows the installed ZX Spectrum ROMs. You can reorder (Move Up, Move Down), rename or delete each of them, as well as choose the one that will be loaded by default at startup (Set Active ).

==== Upgrade

[.text-center] 
image:img/bios3.png[pdfwidth=70%]

_Upgrade_ screen is used to perform the different updates of the Flash memory content: esxdos, BIOS, Cores, etc. (see <<#_updates,the section corresponding to updates>> for more information).

<<<

==== Boot

[.text-center] 
image:img/bios4.png[pdfwidth=70%]

In the _Boot_ screen you can choose which one of the installed cores is loaded by default at startup.

<<<

==== Advanced

[.text-center] 
image:img/bios5.png[pdfwidth=70%]

The Advanced configuration screen is used to edit the following settings:

- Keyboard layout (Keyb Layout): See <<#_keyboard,the corresponding section>> for more information)
- Joystick behavior when emulated with the numeric keypad (Joy Keypad): Kempston, Sinclair Joystick 1, Sinclair Joystick 2, Protek or Fuller
- Behavior of a joystick connected to the port (Joy DB9): Kempston, Sinclair Joystick 1, Sinclair Joystick 2, Protek, Fuller or simulate the keys `Q`,` A`, `O`,` P`, `Space` and `M`
- Video output: PAL, NTSC or VGA
- Scanline simulation: Enabled or Disabled
- VGA horizontal frequency: 50, 51, etc.
- CPU speed: Normal (1x) or accelerated (2X, 3X, etc.)
- Csync: Spectrum or PAL

<<<

==== Exit

[.text-center] 
image:img/bios6.png[pdfwidth=70%]

Finally, from the last screen you can:

- Exit BIOS configuration saving changes (in some cases a power reset is also neeeded)
- Discard changes and exit
- Save changes without exiting
- Discard Changes

== ZX Spectrum

The main core is the one implementing a ZX Spectrum computer. This core is special, and it cannot be replaced for another that is not a ZX Spectrum, since the ZXDOS+ uses it for its operation.

These are some of its main characteristics:

- ZX Spectrum 48K, 128K, Pentagon and Chloe 280SE implementation
- ULA with ULAplus, Timex and Radastan modes (including hardware scroll and selectable palette group)
- Ability to disable memory contention (for Pentagon 128 compatibility)
- Ability to choose the keyboard behavior (issue 2 or issue 3)
- Possibility to choose the timing of the ULA (48K, 128K or Pentagon)
- Control of screen framing, configurable for type of timing, and possibility to choose between original Spectrum synchronisms or progressive PAL standard.
- Timex horizontal MMU support with HOME, DOC and EXT banks in RAM.
- Programmable raster interruption in line number, for any TV line.
- Possibility of activating/deactivating memory bank management registers, for better compatibility with each implemented model
- Ability to activate / deactivate the devices incorporated into the core to improve compatibility with certain programs
- ZXMMC and DIVMMC support for + 3e, esxdos and compatible firmwares
- Turbo Sound support
- SpecDrum support
- Each channel A, B, C of the two AY-3-8912, beeper and SpecDrum chips can be directed to the left, right, both or neither outputs, allowing the implementation of configurations such as ACB, ABC, etc.
- Real joystick and keyboard joystick support with Kempston, Sinclair 1 and 2, Cursor, Fuller and QAOPSpcM protocol.
- Turbo mode support at 7MHz, 14MHz, 28MHz
- Keyboard support (PS/2 protocol) and user-configurable mapping from within Spectrum itself.
- PS/2 mouse support emulating the Kempston Mouse protocol.
- Possibility of video output in RGB 15kHz, or VGA.
- User selectable vertical refresh rate to improve compatibility with VGA monitors
- Multicore boot support: from the Spectrum you can select an address of the SPI Flash and the FPGA will load a core from there
- Different colour modes including monochrome
- I^2^S audio output (with the <<#_rtci2spizero_addon,RTC+I^2^S+Pizero addon>>)

=== microSD advanced format (+3e)

ZX Spectrum +3e is one ROM that can be used with ZX Spectrum core. This is an improved Sinclair ZX Spectrum +3, wich can use hard disks or memory cards.

+3e uses its own partition format (called IDEDOS), to split de hard disk into several partitions to store data. ROM version 1.28 and later can share IDEDOS partitions with MBR partitions. In other case, you must reserve the whole card for IDEDOS partitions.

[CAUTION]
====
The following partition scheme can only be used with ZX Spectrum core.
====

[TIP]
====
Each partition in IDEDOS can be between 1 and 16 Megabytes (16 million bytes) in size, and each disk can have between 1 and 65535 partitions. This means that the maximum space used in a card is about 1 TB.
====

This is one method to split a card into two or three parts, with the first partition IDEDOS (1GB), the second one FAT16 (4GB) and the third one FAT32 (using the remaining space in the card).

exsdos and other programs can be installed into the second partition <<#_esxdos,as explained earlier>>.

==== Windows

You can use Windows Disk Management utility. The steps are:

. Remove all partitions from the card

. Create a new extended partition, using the desired space for IDEDOS

. Create a primary partition, 4GB in size, and format as FAT16

. Optionally, create another primary partition using the remaining space and format as FAT32

<<<

==== MacOS

You will have to use the command line. The first task is to find out which device is the disk to format:

[source,shell]
----
diskutil list
----

For this example, it will be disk 6:

[source]
----
(...)
/dev/disk6 (external, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.9 GB    disk6
   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 UNKNOWN                 15.9 GB    disk6s1
----

Instruction steps:

. Unmount the disk and edit the partition sceme (the second step requires admin privileges):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6

<<<

==== Linux

You can use the command line. First, find out the device to erase:

[source,shell]
----
lsblk
----

For this example, it will be `sdc`:

[source]
----
NAME         MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
(..)
sdc          179:0    0 15,8G  0 disk 
└─sdc1       179:1    0 15,8G  0 part 
----

Instructions:

. Verify that the disk isn't mounted and edit the partition scheme (this step requires root privileges):

[source,shell]
----
sudo fdisk --compatibility=dos /dev/sdc
----

[source]
----
Welcome to fdisk
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

==== +3e

Once the microSD card is ready to use, you can start Spectrum core with a +3e ROM and format the IDEDOS part.

The first step is determine the disk geometry. With the cart inserted into the ZXDOS+, type the command:

[source,basic]
----
CAT TAB
----

This will give a result showing the number of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder-head-sector[cylinders, heads and sectors].

Whith this info, we estimate the size of our partition, using cylinders. For example, if the number of cylinders is 32768, and we want to use 1GB of a 16GB card, the number of cylinders needes would be 32768/16=2048. This way, the IDEDOS partition can be formatted using that number:

[source,basic]
----
FORMAT TO 0,100,2048
----

The first value (`0`) is the drive to use (the first one), the second value is the maximum number of IDEDOS partitions, and the third one yis the number of cylinders to use.

Once formatted, you can create new partitions. For example, to create a 16MB partition with the name "Software", another 4GB partition named "Swap" (to use as swap) and another one name "Utils", 8MB in size:

[source,basic]
----
NEW DATA "Software",16
NEW EXP "Swap1",4
NEW DATA "Utils",8
----

For more information about the different +3e disk commands , you can check https://worldofspectrum.org/zxplus3e/index.html[this page at World of Spectrum].

=== Keyboard

The keyboard map (physical keys of the keyboard assignment to the keystrokes that are presented to the different cores) is changed using the `Advanced` menu of the BIOS. There are three different maps to choose from: Spanish (default), English, and Spectrum (advanced).

You can also change it using the `keymap` utility. Inside `/bin` you have to create a directory named `keymaps` and copy inside the keyboard map files that you want to use. For example, to switch to the US map you have to write `.keymap us` from esxdos.

For the map to be preserved after a master reset, it has to be selected as `Default` in the BIOS.

For more information, see https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=208[this message in the ZX-Uno forum].

==== Special keys and buttons

The following gomaDOS+ key combinations are in `ZX` keyboard mode. Please check <<#_gomados_keyboard_modes,the corresponding section>> for more information. You can also use `PC XT` keyboard mode combinations (like `Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+2` instead of `Caps Shift+1`).

Special keys which can be used during startup:

- `F2` (`Caps Shift+1` on gomaDOS+) Enter BIOS setup
- `Caps Lock` or `Cursor down` (`Caps Shift+2` on gomaDOS+) or, if a joystick is connected, pressing `down`: Core selection menu
- `Esc` (`Caps Shift+Space` on gomaDOS+), or if a joystick with two or more fire buttons is connected, pressing the 2nd fire button: ZX Spectrum core ROM selection menu
- `R`: Loads the Spectrum core ROM in "real" mode, disabling esxdos, new graphics modes, etc.
- `/` (numeric keyboard, `Symbol Shift+V` on gomaDOS+): Load the default ZX Spectrum core ROM in "root" mode
- Number from `1` to `9`: Load the core in the flash location corresponding to that number

Special keys that can be used while running the main core (ZX Spectrum):

- `Esc` (`Caps Shift+Space` on gomaDOS+): BREAK
- `F1`: (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+1` on gomaDOS+): Select one of the monochrome color modes
- `F2` (`Caps Shift+1` on gomaDOS+): Edit
- `F5` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+5` on gomaDOS+): NMI
- `F7` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+7` on gomaDOS+): Play or pause when playing .PZX files
- `F8` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+8` on gomaDOS+): Rewind .PZX file to the previous mark
- `F10` (`Caps Shift+9` on gomaDOS+): Graph
- `F12` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+W` on gomaDOS+): Turbo Boost. Speeds up CPU to 28MHz while pressed (beginnig with core EXP27).
- `Ctrl+Alt+Backspace` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+B` on gomaDOS+): Hard reset. Backspace is the delete key, located in the top-right portion of the keyboard, above `Enter`.
- `Ctrl+Alt+Supr` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+N` on gomaDOS+): Soft reset.
- `Scroll Lock` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+G` on gomaDOS+): Switches between RGB and VGA video modes.

<<<

=== ROMs

The ZX Spectrum core can be initialized using different ROM versions (48K, 128K, Plus 2, etc.). These are stored in the flash memory of the ZXDOS+, and you can choose which one to load by pressing the `Esc` (`Caps Shift+Space` on gomaDOS+) key during boot. You can also define the ROM that you want to load by default using the BIOS setup.

See the <<#_roms_3,updates section>> for more information on how to expand or modify the ROMs stored in flash memory.

==== DerbyPro

https://www.facebook.com/groups/DerbyPro[DerbyPro or Derby{pp}] is an enhanced firmware ROM for the ZX Spectrum, based on v1.4 of the Derby development ROM. The Spectrum 128 (codename "Derby") was a Spanish machine commissioned by Investronica and launched in 1985. It came with a keypad that provided additional editing keys. In 1986, the UK version came out with a simplified version of 128 BASIC and no keypad. Derby++ is developed from the Spanish ROM to include the benefits of both versions, without the drawbacks, and support for new hardware developments.

You can download the ROM, a user manual and other files from the https://www.facebook.com/groups/DerbyPro[official Facebook Public Group].

Since it is a 64K ROM with support for new hardware, these flags can be used when <<#_zx123_tool,adding it to the SPI flash>>:

[align="center",width="60%",%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|Flag
|Meaning
|`d`
|Enable DivMMC
|`n`
|Enable NMI DivMMC (esxdos Menu)
|`t`
|Use 128K timings

<<<

==== CargandoLeches

CargandoLeches is a set of ZX Spectrum ROMs that started as a project to load games in any Spectrum model 15-20x faster. No tape is needed, but a digital audio source, as a computer, mobile device, MP3 player, etc. The new ROM detects the loading method and reverts to the original ROM code if needed. This is handled transparently, with no user or program intervention.

Since version 2.0 the project changed from a single ROM to more, each one with different options. This way, you can choose a different mix of options that may include:

- Ultrafast loading
- Reset & Play (After a sofware reset of the core, the system is ready to load from tape)
- POKE editor
- Enable or disable Sinclair BASIC token expansion

The whole ROM set is available to download from the repository in GitHub https://github.com/antoniovillena/CargandoLeches/tree/master/binaries[here].

Depending on which ROM you choose, the flags when <<#_zx123_tool,adding to the SPI flash>> may vary. For example, for the ROM `48le_ea_re_po` (with all features enabled), these flags can be used (we cannot enable NMI DivMMC since the POKE editor will use it):

[align="center",width="60%",%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|Flag
|Meaning
|`d`
|Enable DivMMC
|`h`
|Disable ROM high bit (1FFD bit 2)
|`l`
|Disable ROM low bit (7FFD bit 4)
|`x`
|Disable Timex mode
|===

===== POKEs

When using a ROM with POKE option enabled:

. Once the game is loaded, after pressing NMI (`F5` or `Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+5` on gomaDOS+) a field will appear in the upper left corner of the screen
. Enter the POKE address and press `Enter`
. Enter the POKE value and press `Enter` again
. Repeat steps 2. and 3. until all the desired POKEs are entered. To finish and return to the game, press `Enter` twice

<<<

===== Preparing ultrafast loading tapes

The ROMs with ultrafast loading enabled, need special tape audio data which is made from normal loading `TAP` files, without protections or turbo loading.

In order to create an ultrafast loading tape you need  `leches` and `CgLeches` command line utilities. Those can be obtained, for Windows, from the
https://github.com/antoniovillena/CargandoLeches/tree/master/binaries[official repository]. You can also obtain an unofficial version for MacOS from  https://github.com/kounch/CargandoLeches/tree/master/binaries/MacOS[this other repository].

In any other case, you can compile from the https://github.com/antoniovillena/CargandoLeches[source code at the official repository]. For example, in Linux, to compile using `gcc` you only need these commands:

[source,shell]
----
gcc leches.c -o leches
gcc CgLeches.c -o CgLeches
----

To create an ultrafast loading tape you have to use the `CgLeches` command from a terminal, giving, at least, the path to the original `TAP` file and also to the new file to create (`WAV` or `TZX`). There are also some other optional parameters, like the loading speed, between 0 and 7 (where 0 is fastest but also more incompatible), if you want to create a mono or stereo file (when making a `WAV`), and more.

Thus, to make a `WAV` file with an ultrafast loading tape from the file `Valley.tap`, with loading speed 5, you could type:

[source,shell]
----
(...) CgLeches Valley.tap Valley.wav 5
----

This way, the file `Valley.wav` can be played from a computer or another device and load using the ROM (see the section about <<#_loading_from_tape,loading from tape>> for more info).

[WARNING]
====
Due to hardware limitations, `TZX` files made with `CgLeches` do not work with a <<#_miniduino,Miniduino>>, although they usually work with <<#_playtzx,`PlayTZX`>>.

==== SE Basic IV

https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4[SE Basic IV] is a free open-source Z80 interpreter for Microsoft BASIC. SE Basic IV is designed to run on the https://www.patreon.com/chloe280se[Chloe 280SE] but it can also run on ZX-Uno and similar computers.

SE Basic was originally conceived as a new firmware for the https://sinclair.wiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_SE[ZX Spectrum SE]. The earliest versions of SE Basic were patches applied to the original ZX Spectrum ROM, but later versions have been rewritten based on the https://groups.google.com/g/comp.sys.sinclair/c/F90HbKTDkRk[open source TS1000 / ZX81 improved ROM]. 

Version 3, also known as https://zxdesign.itch.io/opense[OpenSE BASIC], is still maintained as an open source replacement firmware for the Spectrum. It’s https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/opense-basic[included in the main Debian repository] for use with emulators.

Version IV is a fork of the previous version, done because there was no room left to add new features to the 16K ROM. The initial release (4.0 Anya) added another 16K ROM with support for Timex hi-res mode. The syntax was still largely Sinclair BASIC compatible at this point. Version 4.2 was rebuilt specifically for the Chloe 280SE, dropping support for legacy devices such as tape, adding full compatibility and integrated support for the esxdos kernel, and migrating to Microsoft BASIC syntax.

While it shares a common code base with many versions of Sinclair BASIC (the TS1000 ROM), it differs from them in significant ways:

- Code page (8-bit ASCII) support.
- Error message localization.
- 38 additional tokens.
- Standard terminal display (80 x 24).
- Terminal character entry (CTRL, META).
- Keyboard buffer.
- Full sized keyboard support.

The main differences from Microsoft BASIC are:

- Token abbreviation.
- On-entry syntax checking.
- Typically, brackets are optional.
- Motorola style number entry:
  % – binary
  @ – octal
  $ – hexadecimal
- Always-on expression evaluation.
- Separate logical and bitwise operators.
- Automatic data typing. 

You can find much more information, including the user manual, etc. at https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4/wiki[the official wiki page].

=== esxdos

==== Basic Guide

There are two different kind of esxdos commands, the so-called "DOT" commands, which, as the name suggests, begin with a period, and the commands that are extensions to the existing ones in BASIC.

The main "DOT" commands are the following:

- `128`: Para enter 128K mode from within 48K mode
- `cd`: Change current working directory
- `chmod`: Change file attributes
- `cp`: Copy a file
- `divideo`: Play a DivIDEo (.DVO) video file
- `drives`: Show currently available drives
- `dskprobe`: Utility which shows low level content of an storage device
- `dumpmem`: Can dump RAM memory content to a file
- `file`: Tries to recognize the type of data contained in a file (like the UNIX command)
- `gramon`: Monitor to search graphics, sprites, fonts, etc. in RAM memory
- `hexdump`: Shows the contents of a file using hexadecimal notation
- `hexview`: Allow to see and navigate through the contents os a file using hexadecimal notation
- `launcher`: Creates a shortcut (launcher) to open directly a TAP file
- `ls`: Show the content of a directory
- `lstap`: Show the content of a .TAP file
- `mkdir`: Create a directory
- `mktrd`: Create a .TRD disk file
- `more`: Show the content of a text file
- `mv`: Move a file
- `partinfo`: Show partition information of an storage device
- `playpt3`: Play .PT3 music file
- `playsqt`: Play .SQT music file
- `playstc`: Play .STC music file
- `playtfm`: Play .TFC music file
- `playwav`: Play .WAV audio file
- `rm`: Remove a file or a directory
- `snapload`: Load snapshot file
- `speakcz`: Reads text aloud using czech pronunciation
- `tapein`: Mounts a .TAP file so that it can be used then from BASIC using LOAD sentence
- `tapeout`: Mount a .TAP file so that it can be used then from BASIC using SAVE sentence
- `vdisk`: Mount a .TRD disk file to use with the TR-DOS environment (once all the drives have been mounted, you can enter TR-DOS emulation by typing: `RANDOMIZE USR 15616`)

Some BASIC extended commands are:

- `GO TO` to change the current drive and/or directory (e.g.: `GO TO hd1` or `GO TO hd0"games"`)
- `CAT` to show the content of a drive
- `LOAD` to lad a file from a drive (BASIC Program, SCREEN, CODE, etc. for example `LOAD *"Screen.scr" SCREEN$`)
- `SAVE` to save data in a file (e.g: `SAVE *"Program.bas"`)
- `ERASE` to delete a file

In addition, esxdos also has an NMI manager, an application that loads when NMI (`F5` or `Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+5` on gomaDOS+) is pressed, and lets you browse the microSD card and load easily files (TAP, Z80, TRD, etc.). Pressing the "H" key invokes a help screen, which shows all the available keys.

[NOTE]
====
The esxdos manager shows file and directory entries in the order stored in the internal FAT table, and not alphabetically. If you want to see them ordered, you have to reorder the microSD card structure with a utility like Fat Sorter for Windows, https://fatsort.sourceforge.io/[FATsort] for Linux and MacOS, https://www.luisrios.eti.br/public/en_us/projects/yafs/[YAFS], http://www.trustfm.net/software/utilities/SDSorter.phpp[SDSorter] or other.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Ïf the card is also being used with the <<#_pc_xt,PC XT>> core, **do not use any FAT reordering utility** as it may stop DOS from booting.

<<<

==== ZXDOS+ Commands

As explained in the installation part, there are a series of commands that are exclusive to ZXDOS+:

- `back16m`: Dumps to a `FLASH.ZX1` file, in the root directory of the microSD card, the contents of a 16 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM. After finishing, it is necessary to execute the command `.ls` so that the cache is written to the card
- `backzx2` or `backzxd`: Creates a `FLASH.ZX2` o `FLASH.ZXD` file, in the root directory of the microSD card, with the contents of a 32 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM.After finishing its execution, you must execute the command `.ls` to finish recording the cache on the microSD card. If not, the length of the file will be wrongly set to 0
- `corebios`: To upddate simultaneously ZX Spectrum core and BIOS
- `dmaplayw`: Plays .WAV file, which has to be 8 bits, unsigned and sampled at 15625 Hz
- `esprst`: Resets the WiFi ESP8266(ESP-12) module

- `playrmov`: Plays <<#_making_rdm_radastan_movie_files,radastanian format video files `.RDM`)>>. This command does not work on 48K mode.
- `romsback`: Dumps to a RomPack File named `ROMS.ZX1`, in the root directory of the microSD card, all ZX Spectrum core ROMS which are stored in SPI flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM. Only works correctly on ZX-Uno and ZXDOS (do not use on ZXDOS+ or gomaDOS+).
- `romsupgr`: Load from a RomPack filel named `ROMS.ZX1`, in the root directory of the microSD card, all ZX Spectrum core ROMS into SPI flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM
- `upgr16m`: Load the content of a `FLASH.ZX1` file, in the root directory of the microSD card, to a 16 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM
- `upgrzx2` or `upgrzxd`: Write the content of a `FLASH.ZX2` o `FLASH.ZXD` file, in the root directory of the microSD card, to a 32 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM.
- `zxuc`: Utility to configure al options of BIOS, which also can be stored in the microSD in configuration files that can be loaded later
- `zxunocfg`: Configuration utillity for certain features of ZX-Uno such as timings, contention, keyboard type, CPU speed, video type or vertical frequency

<<<

=== Wi-Fi

Each gomaDOS+, and some models of ZXDOS+, include inside an ESP-12 module with an https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266[ESP8266] Wi-Fi chip, that can be easily used with a ZX Spectrum core (e.g., EXP27 160820 core) which has synthesized an https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Asynchronous_Receiver-Transmitter[UART] device, that allows communication with the module.

There are two "DOT" commands for configuring software access to the module. Then can be downloaded from https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/utils[GitHub official repository]:

- `esprst`, which restarts the module
- `iwconfig`, to register the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password, keeping them in the file `/sys/config/iw.cfg`.

For example:
[source,shell]
----
.iwconfig mywifi mypassword
----

==== Network tools for ZX-Uno pack

These are programs, developed by Nihirash and that are available to https://nihirash.net/network-tools-for-zx-uno-pack/[download] https://nihirash.net/ugophy-1-0-and-nettools-for-zx-spectrum/#more-71[from his web].

- `netman`: Utility to configure the ESP Wi-Fi chip for other programs from Nihirash. Does not work in 48K mode
- `uGophy`: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher[Gopher] client. Does not work in 48K mode
- `irc`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat[Internet Relay Chat] client. Works better at 14 Mhz
- `wget`: Utility to download files with HTTP (does not work with HTTPS)
- `platoUNO`: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_Logic_Automated_Teaching_Operations[PLATO] client. Also works better at 14 Mhz. For more information about PLATO, check https://www.irata.online/#about[IRATA.ONLINE] web

==== FTP-Uno

FTP cliente developed by Yombo, available https://github.com/yomboprime/FTP_Uno[at GitHub].

Configuration steps:

. Edit `FTP.CFG` file with all the required information (SSID and password, FTP server, etc.)
. Copy `FTP.CFG` inside `/SYS/CONFIG/` in microSD card
. Also copy `ftpUno.tap` to any place in the card
. Start up ZXDOS+ andload the tape file `ftpUno.tap`

<<<

==== UART Terminal

Program example included with https://github.com/yomboprime/ZXYLib[ZXYLib] C library, developed by yombo, that let's you send directly typed characters using the UART, and also see the result. Available to download https://github.com/yomboprime/ZXYLib/raw/master/UARTTERM.tap[at this link].

Once the file `UARTTERM.tap` is in the card and loaded, you can type several specific commands for ESP8266 chip. For example:

- `AT`. To check if ther is communication. `OK` would be the result if everything is fine
- `AT+RST`. To restart the chip. Exactly what <<#_wi_fi,`esprst`>> command does
- `AT+GMR`. To see some information, like firmware version, etc.
- `AT+CWMODE_CUR=1`. Put temporarily the chip into Wi-Fi client mode, until next restart
- `AT+CWMODE_DEF=1`. Put temporarily the chip into Wi-Fi client mode, and save it as default
- `AT+CWJAP_CUR="<WiFiNetwork>","<WiFiPassword>"`, where `<WiFiNetwork>` Wi-Fi ID of the network to connect to, and `<WiFiPassword>` the access password, connects temporarily to that network
- `AT+CWJAP_DEF="<WiFiNetwork>","<WiFiPassword>"`, connects to the network, and saves the settings as default in the chip flash memory
- `AT+CWAUTOCONN=1` sets the chip to connect automatically on boot to the default network (`AT+CWAUTOCONN=0` disables it)

You can see all the available commands reading the https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/4a-esp8266_at_instruction_set_en.pdf[official documentation].

=== Making RDM (RaDastan Movie) files

The `PLAYRMOV` "DOT" command plays radastanian format video files. To convert your own videos, you need `makevideoradas`, a utility that is available at https://svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/software/modo_radastan/videos_radastanianos/[SVN repository]. 

If using Windows, there is already an executable file (`makevideoras.exe`). For Linux or MacOS, you must have installed command line developer utilities in order to compile an executable

[source,shell]
----
gcc makevideoradas.c -o makevideoradas
----

Apart from `makevdideoradas`, you need another two tools: https://ffmpeg.org[`ffmpeg`] and https://imagemagick.org/index.php[`imagemagick`]. These can be installed with a package manager (`apt`, `yum`, `pacmam`, `brew`, etc.) or downloading the source code and compiling.

Now, the first step to convert our video (for example `myvideo.mp4`), is exporting the frames as 128x96 pixel BMP image files. We create a temporary file  (`img` for this example), to store them.

[source,shell]
----
mkdir img
(...)/ffmpeg -i myvideo.mp4 -vf "scale=128:96,fps=25" -start_number 0 img/output%05d.bmp
----

Now we transform the `BMP` files to 16 colours (v3) `BMP` files.

[source,shell]
----
(...)/magick mogrify -colors 16 -format bmp -define bmp:format=bmp3 img/*.bmp
----

Finally, we assemble the `.RDM` file (in this example `myvideo.rdm`) and cleanup the temporary files and directory.

[source,shell]
----
(...)/makevideoradas img/output
mv img/output.rdm ../myvideo.rdm
rm -rf img
----

There is more information about all this process at https://www.zonadepruebas.com/viewtopic.php?t=4796&start=110[this thread in Zona de Pruebas forums].

== Upgrade 

=== BIOS

To update the BIOS, a file named `FIRMWARE.ZX2` (for a ZXDOS+ with an FPGA LX16 board) or `FIRMWARE.ZXD` (for a ZXDOS+ with an FPGA LX25 board) must be obtained. The latest version of the firmware files can be downloaded from https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/firmware[the official repository]

[CAUTION]
====
Updating the firmware (BIOS) is delicate. It should not be done if it is not necessary. If doing so, ensure that the ZXDOS+ has uninterrupted power (such as a UPS or a laptop USB with battery).
====

Copy the file to the root of the MicroSD card, turn on and press `F2` to enter BIOS, select `Upgrade`, choose __"Upgrade BIOS for ZX"__, and then __"SDfile"__. The system will read the file `FIRMWARE...` and notify when finished.

=== ROMs

The flash memory of a ZXDOS+ has reserved 64 slots, 16K each, to store ZX Spectrum ROM images. Thus, an original ZX Spectrum ROM (16K) will take one slot, a ZX Spectrum 128K ROM (32K) will be two slots, and a ZX Spectrum +2A ROM (64K) will need 4 slots.

You can add a new ROM pressing the key `N` at the BIOS <<#_roms,ROMs screen>>, connecting an audio cable to the board, and playing a ROM audio tape. ROM audio tapes can be made from a `.tap` file built with the `GenRom` utility, available at https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/modflash[ZX-Uno Code Repository].

To update at once all the ROMs installed for ZX Spectrum, a RomPack file named `ROMS.ZX1` must be obtained, which must be copied to the MicroSD card. Boot the ZXDOS+ using a "rooted" ROM, and then just enter the command `.romsupgr`. This will burn all the ROMs, which will be available for use.

[WARNING]
====
At this moment, `romsupgr`, only works correctly with RomPack files using a maximum of 35 slots.
====

[NOTE]
====
Remember that if the ZXDOS+ is started by pressing the `/` key (on the numeric keyboard, `Symbol Shift+V` in gomaDOS+), then the default ROM of the ZX Spectrum core will be loaded in" root "mode.
====

To do the opposite process (save the ROMs in a RomPack file named `ROMS.ZX1`), you can use the` .romsback` command.

[NOTE]
====
At this moment, `romsback`, only stores correctly the first 35 used slots.
====

RomPack files can be easily edited with the http: // guest: zxuno@svn.zxuno.comsvn/zxuno/software/ZX1RomPack/[ZX1RomPack] utility. Although it is a Windows program, it works perfectly, for example using https://www.winehq.org[Wine] or similar programs, either on MacOS or Linux.

=== Cores

There are a number of available spaces where you can store cores (the number depends on the size of the SPI Flash of the ZXDOS+ model), the first space being reserved for the main ZX Spectrum (this does not prevent having more ZX Spectrum cores in other space as well of the first).

Official cores are https://github.com/zxdos/zxdos-plus/tree/master/cores[available to download] from GitHub repository.

To update or install a new core there are several possibilities. 

The easiest way is to obtain the latest version of the file that defines the core, which will be a file that must be named `COREnn.ZX2` (for a ZXDOS + with an FPGA LX16 board) or `COREnn.ZXD` (for a ZXDOS + with an LX25 board), where `nn` is the slot number where to install (for example `CORE2.ZX2` or `CORE2.ZXD` for slot 2).

[NOTE]
====
Starting with BIOS version 0.80, files are named using the `COREXXy.ZXn` convention where XX _always_ is a two-digit number. Thus, an old `CORE4.ZXD` file has to be renamed as `CORE04.ZXD`. The `y` part of the name is ignored, so longer and more descriptive names can be used (such as `CORE04_example.ZXD`).
====

Copy the file to the root of the microSD card, turn on and press `F2` to enter BIOS. Choose `Upgrade`, select the row corresponding to the chosen core number (for example, 2 - just after Spectrum), press enter and then __" SD file "__. The system will read the file `COREnn ..` and warn when it is updated, although first it will ask for the name (to be shown in the list to choose from at startup and in the BIOS list).

[WARNING]
====
The ZX Spectrum core update is exactly the same as other cores, but instead of the name `CORE1.ZX2` or `CORE1.ZXD`, it has to be a file named `SPECTRUM.ZX2` or `SPECTRUM.ZXD`.
====

[TIP]
====
Due to some limitations in the FPGA, the cores that are stored in the SPI Flash second half have to be installed without using the space https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/blob/master/firmware/formato_lx25.txt[at address `0x10B0000`]. https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/blob/master/firmware/CORE21_special.ZXD[A special core] has to be there, this makes sure that, when another core installed in the upper half of the flash is reset, the main Spectrum core and the BIOS load correctly.
====

=== esxdos

To update esxdos to a new version, the distribution must be obtained from https://www.esxdos.org[the official website].

Once downloaded and extracted, the contents of `BIN` and `SYS` directories have to be copied to the root of the card, merging the existing ones (to preserve the exclusive ZXDOS+ commands).

Copy `ESXMMC.BIN` (or `ESXMMC.ROM`, depending on version) to the root of the microSD card.

Start ZXDOS + with the card inserted and press `F2` to access BIOS setup. Select the `Upgrade` menu and choose __"Upgrade esxdos for ZX"__. In the dialog that appears choose __"SD file"__ and, when it asks __"Load from SD"__ answer __"Yes"__ to the question __"Are you sure?"__. The content of the file `ESXDOS...` will be read, written to the flash storage and you will be notified when it is updated.

Do a Hard-reset, or turn it off and on.

If everything has been done correctly, when you turn on the ZXDOS+ you will see how esxdos detects the card and loads the necessary components to work, showing the new version at the top.

=== Flash Memory

You also can update all the FPGA flash memory. At this moment, from the BIOS you can only use 16MiB image files. To use a 32MiB image, you must use <<#_esxdos,esxdos>> `UPGRZX2` or `UPGRZXD` command and a file named `FLASH.ZX2` or `FLASH.ZXD`.

Copy the image file (16MiB) `FLASH.ZXD` to the root of the microSD card.

Turn on the ZXDOS+ and press the `F2` key (`Caps Shift+1` on gomaDOS+) during boot to access the BIOS setup. Select the menu `Upgrade` and then choos the option __"Upgrade flash from SD"__. Press Enter, choose `Yes`, and press Enter again to start the Flash writing process.

Do a Hard-Reset or turn of and on again.

[WARNING]
====
This process can't be undone, and it will replace all the previously installed cores, the BIOS, the ZX Spectrum ROMs and their configuration with the data in the image file.

=== ZX Spectrum Next

https://www.specnext.com[ZX Spectrum Next] is an FPGA based project, which wants to be the evolution of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum line of computers. It brings new features while keeping hardware and software compatibility with previous ZX Spectrum computers.

Specially thanks to avlixa, there exists a ZX Spectrum Next core synthesized for ZXDOS+.

The core, for the moment does not have any of these features:

- Internal beeper
- EDGE expansion Connector
- RTC module
- Membrane keyboard
- Flashing additional cores or upgrading the Next core from within the Next core
- MIC out
- HDMI Video
- UART communication using the joystick port

It can also have these features, which do not exist in the original core:

- Different colour modes including monochrome
- I^2^S audio output (with the <<#_rtci2spizero_addon,RTC+I^2^S+Pizero addon>>)

The user manual is available to download at https://www.specnext.com/zx-spectrum-next-user-manual-first-edition/[the official web page].

[TIP]
====
To use a Raspberry Pi as accelerator, you need a core version with Pi Zero support, and the RTC+I^2^S+Pizero addon. See the other hardware <<#_rtci2spizero_addon,section>> for more info.
====

<<<

==== microSD card format

You have to use a microSD card with the first partition formatted as FAT16 or FAT32, and inside, the standard esxDOS distribution, matching ZXDOS+ BIOS version (see <<#_esxdos,esxdos corresponding section>> for more info).

Download NextZXOS distribution https://www.specnext.com/latestdistro/[from the official page].

Extract NextZXOS in the root of the microSD card, and then edit `config.ini` under `c:/machines/next` to include the line `ps2=0` if it doesn't exist or edit the existing line from 1 to 0. This effectively switches the dual PS/2 port to keyboard first as the Next Firmware (TBBLUE.FW) switches the primary input to mouse. Also edit the line `intbeep=0` to disable the internal beeper (this last step is not necesary on gomaDOS+).

If it wasn't already, <<#_cores,install ZX Spectrum Next core>> into ZXDOS+.

==== Keyboard
 
===== Special keys and buttons

The following gomaDOS+ key combinations are in `ZX` keyboard mode. Please check <<#_gomados_keyboard_modes,the corresponding section>> for more information. You can also use `PC XT` keyboard mode combinations .

Take into account that `Ctrl+Alt+backspace` does not work with the ZX Spectrum Next core. You have to power cycle if you want to use another core. Also, there is no Reset or Drive button.

While the core is running:

- `F1` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+1` on gomaDOS+): Hard Reset
- `F2` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+2` on gomaDOS+): Scandoubler. Doubles the resolution. Should be of for SCART
- `F3` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+3` on gomaDOS+): Change vertical frequency between 50Hz and 60Hz
- `F4` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+4` on gomaDOS+): Soft Reset
- `F7` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+7` on gomaDOS+): Scanlines
- `F9` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+9` on gomaDOS+): NMI
- `F10` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+0` on gomaDOS+): divMMC NMI. Simulates Drive button. If used with Caps Shift it forces a rescan of drives and a reload of the boot screen under esxDOS
- `F11`: (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+Q` on gomaDOS+): Select one of the monochrome color modes
- `F12` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+W in gomaDOS+): Switch between standard audio and I^2^S output, if the <<#_rtci2spizero_addon,RTC+I^2^S+PI0 addon>> is connected. Take note that enabling I^2^S disables partially the Raspberry Pi audio.

<<<

==== Basic Guide

On first boot, some help screens will show up. After pressing `Space` key, NextZXOS Startup Menu appears.

[.text-center] 
image:img/next.png[pdfwidth=70%]

You can navigate the menu with the cursor keys, `5`, `6`, `7` and `8` keys, or a joystick (if configured as Kempston, MD or cursor). `Enter` or the joystick button chooses one element.

`More...` shows a second menu with more options.

[.text-center] 
image:img/next2.png[pdfwidth=70%]

<<<

If you choose `Browser`, NextZXOS Browser will start, and then you can see the contents of the microSD card and load a file (TAP, NEX, DSK, SNA, SNX, Z80, Z8, etc.).

[NOTE]
====
The browser shows file and directory entries in the order stored in the internal FAT table, and not alphabetically. If you want to see them ordered, yo have to reorder the microSD card structure with a utility like Fat Sorter for Windows, https://fatsort.sourceforge.io/[FATsort] for Linux and MacOS, https://www.luisrios.eti.br/public/en_us/projects/yafs/[YAFS], http://www.trustfm.net/software/utilities/SDSorter.phpp[SDSorter] or other.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Ïf the card is also being used with the <<#_pc_xt,PC XT>> core, **do not use any FAT reordering utility** as it may stop DOS from booting.
====

[.text-center] 
image:img/next3.png[pdfwidth=70%]

[INFO]
====
The ZX Spectrum Next core for ZXDOS+ needs the <<#_rtci2spizero_addon,Raspberry Pi based Accelerator>> to load TZX files.
====

[NOTE]
====
It is not possible to load TRD files directly from the Browser (NextZXOS must be configured to load a "personality" with esxdos).

- Reconfigurable keyboard map
- Scanlines
- Joystick support
- I^2^S audio output (with the <<#_rtci2spizero_addon,RTC+I^2^S+Pizero addon>>)

==== microSD card format

You have to use a microSD card with the first partition in FAT16 format with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type[code `0x06` (16-bit FAT)]. You can also use a second FAT16 partition for MSX software, and leaving the first one only for the system startup.

You need to get:

- Basic SD project files SD https://github.com/fbelavenuto/msx1fpga/tree/master/Support/SD[from GitHub]
- Nextor driver (`NEXTOR.SYS`) and ROM (`NEXTOR.ROM`) https://github.com/fbelavenuto/msx1fpga/tree/master/Software/nextor[also from GitHub]
- MSX1 ROM (`MSX_INT.rom`, `MSX_JP.rom` or `MSX_USA.rom`) https://github.com/fbelavenuto/msx1fpga/tree/master/Software/msx1[at the same repository]

Copy the contents of the https://github.com/fbelavenuto/msx1fpga/tree/master/Support/SD[SD directory] in the root of the first partition of the microSD.

[WARNING]
====
Because some of DOS directories and files may have the same name, it's not recommended to use the same card for the <<#_pc_xt,PC XT core>> and MSX.
====

Copy `NEXTOR.SYS` to the same place.

Copy `NEXTOR.ROM` inside the `MSX1FPGA` directory.

Copy one MSX1 ROM (`MSX_INT.rom`, `MSX_JP.rom` or `MSX_USA.rom`) inside the `MSX1FPGA` directory, but renaming it to `MSX1BIOS.ROM`.

The file `/MSX1FPGA/config.txt` keeps the core configuration, using this format:

----

=== Acorn Atom

https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Atom[Acorn Atom] was  a home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd. The ZXDOS+ core (based on the ZX-Uno core made by Quest) is an adaptation of the https://github.com/hoglet67/AtomFpga[AtomFPGA] project. You can get more information at https://zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4[ZX-Uno Forums].

==== microSD card format

You have to use a microSD card with the first partition in FAT16 format.

Download the latest version of Atom Software Archive https://github.com/hoglet67/AtomSoftwareArchive/releases/latest[from GitHub].

You can set up the files in the microSD in two different ways:

. Extract all the contents of the archive to the root of the microSD card. `SYS` directory contents are compatible with esxdos `SYS` directory, so you can merge both into one.

. Have less files an directories in the root directory. Create a directory named `ATOM` in the microSD root, and copy inside all the uncompressed archive content, except for the directory `MANPAGES` which must also be in root. Then, extract and the files from `trick_ATOM_folder` archive (available https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4006[at ZX-Uno Forum]), replacing any file with the same name. You will get a file and directory structure like this:

=== NES

Nintendo Entertainment System (also known as Nintendo NES or just NES) is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System[second home video game console produced by Nintendo].

The ZXDOS+ core has been made by Nihirash, based on https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1245[the previous version for ZX-Uno] by DistWave andQuest.

Some features of this core are:

- HQ2X filters that "removes pixels" from the image
- Scanlines simulation
- Made with NES NTSC clock timings, so only USA ROMs run fine. PAL ROMs run faster than they sould
- You can load ROMs from the microSD
- You need, at least, one gamepad or joystick connected, and it must have several buttons
- Only VGA video mode is supported, with non-accurate timings, so it may not work with some displays

==== microSD card format

You need a microSD card with the first partition in FAT16 format to store ROM image files of the games to load. ROM files can be inside subdirectories.

==== Basic Guide

[.text-center] 
image:img/lynx.png[pdfwidth=70%]

From within BASIC, you can load from a external tape (or <<#_miniduino,other external audio device>>) with commands like:

[source]
----
TAPE n
LOAD "NAME"
----

Where `n` is a number (between 1 and 5), and `NAME` is mandatory, and the name of the program to load.

If you don't know the name to load, you can guess with the same command sequence, but writing `LOAD ""`.

Binary files are loaded with `MLOAD` instead of `LOAD`.

[NOTE]
====
Maxduino, which is used in <<#_miniduino,miniduino>> does not, at this moment, native support for Lynx tape files.
====

You can use programs like  <<#_audio_file_conversion,Lynx2Wav>> with Lynx `TAP` files. The resulting audio files can be embedded inside of TSX or TZX with tools like <<#_creación_de_ficheros_tzx_o_tsx_desde_otros_formatos,MakeTSX or RetroConverter>>.

The http://retrowiki.es/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=200036835[lince] script makes all this process easier, creating directly Maxduino `TZX` compatible files from Lynx `TAP` files.

=== PC XT

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer_XT[IBM Personal Computer XT] is the second computer in the IBM Personal Computer line. It is very similar to the original IBM PC model 5150 from 1981.

The ZXDOS+ core is an implementation based on https://opencores.org/projects/next186_soc_pc[Next186].

Features:

- Next186 core with 30 MHz CPU (166.66Mhz 32 bit bus)
- 64 MB DDR3 RAM (DDR3-1333 333.33Mhz)
- 40 MHz DSP
- OPL3 support (with fix for adlib detection)
- PS/2 mouse and keyboard support
- BIOS detection in the first 64 or the las 16 sectors of the microSD card

==== microSD card format

An SDHC card is required (so it has to be 4GB or more in size), with the first partition in FAT16 and MS-DOS (or similar) installed. You can achieve this using, for example, virtualization software and attaching directly the microSD device as a hard disk.

Once partitioned and formatted (with the reserved bytes ad the end), the BIOS image file `Next186_BIOS_zxdos_ddr3.COM` (available to download https://github.com/zxdos/sources/raw/master/next186_zxdos_ddr3/software/Next186_BIOS_zxdos_ddr3.COM[at this link]) has to be written somewhere in the first 64 sectors or to the last 16 sectors of the card.

[CAUTION]
====
**Do not use any FAT reordering utility** as it may stop DOS from booting.
====

[WARNING]
====
Because some of MSXDOS system directories and files may have the same name, it's not recommended to use the same card for the <<#_msx,MSX core>> and PC XT.
====

===== Windows

You can use the program https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/[HxD (Hex editor for Windows)]:

. Start the program as administrator and select the option `Open disk...` in the `Tools` menu
. Disable the option to only read, and select the microSD device
. Open in another window the file with the BIOS image
. Copy all the content from the BIOS image, and paste at the end of the microSD, or, if there is enough freespace before the first partition, somewhere within the first 64 sectors (512 bytes in size each)
. Save all changes to the card

<<<

===== Linux

Follow these steps:

. After finding which device belongs to the SD card (`sdb` for this example),  execute `fdisk` to find out the size

[source,shell]
----
fdisk -l /dev/sdb
Disk /dev/sdb: 59.49 GiB, 63864569856 bytes, 124735488 sectors
Disk model: SD/MMC          
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
(...)
----

[start=2]
. As the sector size is 512 bytes, subtract 16 (for this example, `124735488-16=124735472`) and use that info to inject the BIOS at the end:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dd if=Next186_BIOS_zxdos_ddr3.COM of=/dev/sdb bs=512 seek=124735472
----

Instead of the end of the card, if there is enough free space before the first partition, you may use the beginning. For example, to write starting at sector 10:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dd if=Next186_BIOS_zxdos_ddr3.COM of=/dev/sdb bs=512 seek=10
----

===== MacOS

Steps to to follow:

. After finding out which disk is the card (`disk6` for this example),  open `fdisk` to find out the size in sectors

[source,shell]
----
sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
sudo fdisk /dev/rdisk6

Disk: /dev/rdisk6   geometry: 15566/255/63 [30535680 sectors]
(...)
Enter 'help' for information
fdisk: 1>q
----

[start=2]
. As the sectors are 512 bytes in size, substract 16 (for this example, `30535680-16=30535664`) and use that number to inject the data at the end:

[source,shell]
----
sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
sudo dd if=Next186_BIOS_zxdos_ddr3.COM of=/dev/rdisk6 bs=512 seek=30535664
----

Instead of the end of the card, if there is enough free space before the first partition, you may use the beginning. For example, to write starting at sector 10:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dd if=Next186_BIOS_zxdos_ddr3.COM of=/dev/rdisk6 bs=512 seek=10
----

See the <<#_cores,corresponding section>> for instructions of how to install the PC XT core in ZXDOS+.

==== Keyboard

When using a gomaDOS+, to make the key presses (Spectrum) being similar to a PC keyboard, you can follow these steps:

. Start the gomaDOS+
. Change the keyboard mode to `PC XT` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+U` and then `9`)
. Reboot the gomaDOS+ without losing the temporary keyboard mode (`Caps Shift + Symbol Shift + B`)
. Quickly, press `Caps Shift + 2` and select the PC XT core to boot
. Ensure that the DOS keyboard configuration is in an english mode (`KEYB US,` or `KEYB UK,`)

===== Special keys and buttons

=== Chip-8

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8[CHIP-8] CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. Erik Bryntse later created another interpreter based on CHIP-8, called SCHIP, S-CHIP or Super-Chip which extended the CHIP-8.

The ZXDOS+ core is based on an existing  https://bitbucket.org/csoren/fpga-chip8/[FPGA implementation] of the SuperChip.

There are several sites like https://johnearnest.github.io/chip8Archive/[CHIP-8 Archive] ot https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8[Matthew Mikolay's CHIP-8] where you can obtain osftware for these machines.

==== microSD card format

You can use a SD card with the first partition in FAT16 or FAT32 formata to store `BIN` or `CH8` ROM files to load with the core.

==== Keyboard

The CHIP-9 machine uses an hexadecimal keyboard as input. This is the key mapping:

[align="center",width="25%",%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|Chip-8|PS/2
|`1 2 3 C`|`1 2 3 4`
|`4 5 6 D`|`Q W E R`
|`7 8 9 E`|`A S D F`
|`A 0 B F`|`Z X C V`
|===

===== Special keys and buttons

While the core is running:

== Other Hardware

=== Rotary Encoders

Pong and Atari 2600 cores support the use of quadrature https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder[rotary encoders] as control devices. They can be connected to the joystick ports. Although the testing has been done with 600 ppr encoders, lower ppr encoders, like 400 or 300, should also work.

You can also use an Atari 2600 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_(game_controller)[paddle] driving controller. In this case the playing experience is bad, since they have few ppr and you must do several full rotations. When using them, it's recommended to set the accuracy setting to 8, to have enough speed.

==== Connection

Both ZXDOS+ and gomaDOS+ have joystick pin 5 connected to positive VCC, used as main power, and pin 8 as GND. The rotary encoders to use must support voltage from 3,4v to 5v.

A rotary encoder has 5 wires: Earth Ground (not connected), Vcc (`+`), GND (`0V`or `-`), `A` and `B`.

`A` and `B` are connected to pins 1 and 2 for the first encoder, 3 and 4 for the seconde one. This way you can have up to 4 encoders connected using both joystick ports.

[.text-center] 
image:img/db9joy.png[pdfwidth=40%]

This way, the connections should be:

. Line `A` encoder 1
. Line `B` encoder 1
. Line `A` encoder 2
. Line `B` encoder 2
. Vcc(`+`)
. Fire 1
. NC
. `GND`
. Fire 2

<<<

==== Pong Core Configuration

Follow these directions to choose the configuration:

- For 1 or 2 endoders on joystick port 2 de joystick, select `1/2 Paddle in J2` option
- For 2 encoders, one for each joystick port, select `2/4 Paddle in J1&J2` option. This is also valid to connect two Atari 2600 driving paddles
- For 4 encoders, two for each joystick port, select `2/4 Paddle in J1&J2` option
- For 1 or 2 encoders on joystick port 2 along with a mouse (in this case the encoders are for players 2 and 4), select `Mouse PS/2` option

It is recommended to wait, and make the connection after selecting the chosen option, since the encoders interfere with the up/down directions of the joystick, blocking access to the menu. Another option is to add a on/off switch for the encoder that will disable the power.

=== Loading from tape

Some cores can load, as the original machines could, from a external audio device like a cassette player or something else simulating it.

Besides the card, you have to plug an appropriate audio cable to <<#_ports_and_connectors,ZXDOS+ audio input>>. It must have a 3.5 mm stero jack on one side, and two mono outputs on the other side (one for each audio channel). The right audio mono is connected to the audio player (this is not necessary with a miniduino, since it already uses only the right audio channel when playing).

==== Cassette Player

The use is exactly the same as when using the original computers:

. Plug the audio cable
. Type on the computer or select the tape loading option. For examle, for ZX Spectrum 48K, typing `J`, then, twice, `"` (`Symbol Shift + P` on gomaDOS+) and then `Enter` to do the classic `LOAD "" + Enter`
. Start playing the tape (you may have to try several times adjusting the player volume)

==== Computer

Depending on the operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux) there are several programs that can either play a tape file (`TAP`, `TZX`, `PZX`, etc.) and output the sound through a headphone output, or create an audio file (`WAV`, `VOC`, `AU`, etc.) that can be played using a music or audio program.

===== PlayTZX

This program for Windows, MacOS or Linux, can play directly a `TZX` tape file through the audio output of the computer.

You can download the binary file (for example), for Windows from https://worldofspectrum.net/utilities/#tzxtools[World of Spectrum Classic] and for Mac from https://github.com/kounch/playtzx/releases[this GitHub repository]) or compile the source code as <<#_compile_source_code_macos_or_linux,explained later>>.

. Plug the audio cable between the computer audio output and ZXDOS+ audio input (remember to use only the right mono channel to the PC, Mac, etc. output)
. Type on the computer or select the tape loading option. For examle, for ZX Spectrum 48K, typing `J`, then, twice, `"` (`Symbol Shift + P` on gomaDOS+) and then `Enter` to do the classic `LOAD "" + Enter`
. Start playing a tape file with this command (you may have to try several times adjusting the player volume)

[source,shell]
----
./playtzx <tape file path>
----

If everything works fine, you will see at the shell the name of the different tape data blocks, while the sound is played and the ZXDOS+ core loads the program.

[TIP]
====
On Linux, the program uses as output the device `/dev/dsp`, this may require to load a module like `snd_pcm_oss` (on systems using ALSA).
====

====== Compile source code (MacOS or Linux)

To compile, the first thing is checking that the developer tools are installed on the system, including a C compiler (`gcc`, `clang`, command line developer tools for Mac, etc.) and https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system[GNU Autotools].

Download the source code https://github.com/kounch/playtzx[from this repository]), extract the contents if needed and access from a terminal to the directory and type the commands:

[source,shell]
----
aclocal && autoconf && autoheader && automake --add-missing
./configure
make
----

If all goes well, a new file named `playtzx` has been created, which you can copy anywhere and then use. You can delete the compilation directory.

==== Mobile phone, tablet, MP3 player, etc.

There are a very few apps (or none) that can directly play a tape file on a mobile device so, in many cases, the only option is to convert it to an audio file before playing it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baltazarstudios.playzxtapes[PlayZX] is an App for Android which can play tape files through the headphone output. 

[WARNING]
====
The latest devices with headphone output are normally designed to work with impedances of only a few ohmis. This may, sometimes, not be enouth for the ZXDOS+ audio input.

In these cases, it's recommended (if possible) to disable headphone volume limitations and/or use a headphone amplifier that can give a higher impedance.
====

===== Audio file conversion

These are some of the many programas that exist and which can export tape files to audio files.

https://www.alessandrogrussu.it/tapir/index.html[Tapir] is a GUI program for Windows (but which can also run with Wine on Linux or Mac) that can load `TZX` and `TAP` files and export to `WAV` audio

`tape2wav` from https://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/[Fuse Utilities] is a command line utility that can export from `TZX` `PZX` and `TAP` to `WAV`.

`pzx2wav` in http://zxds.raxoft.cz/pzx.html[PZX Tools] is another command line utility which exports to `WAV`.

`tsx2wav` in https://github.com/nataliapc/MSX_devs/tree/master/TSXphpclass[TSXphpclass] is made with PHP and that can export from `TSX` to `WAV`.

https://github.com/RW-FPGA-devel-Team/lynx2wav[Lynx2Wav] is a program that can convert Camputers Lynx `TAP` files to `WAV` audio.

https://github.com/rcmolina/CamputersLYNX[2lynx2wav] also can convert Camputers Lynx `TAP` files to audio files.

<<<

==== Miniduino

https://www.antoniovillena.es/store/product/miniduino/[Miniduino] is a tape file audio player, based on a STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller with 64KB flash memory, and https://github.com/rcmolina/MaxDuino_BETA[Maxduino] firmware preinstalled.

Maxduino plays, in a very similar way to how https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casete[cassette tape] players worked, digital tape files in format as like `TAP` and `TZX` (ZX Spectrum), `O` (ZX80), `P` (ZX81), `CDT` (Amstrad CPC), `CAS`(MSX) `TSX` (MSX, Acorn, etc). It is also possible to play AY music files as if they were tapes, in order to load the from http://www.specay.co.uk[SpecAY] in a ZX Spectrum.

<<<

===== Configuration

A microSD is needed in order to store the tape files to play. Fast cards (Class 10 or greater) aren't recommended because there can be problems while reading the data. High capacity (SDXC or greater) cards aren't recommended too.

The card must have the first partition formatted as FAT16 or FAT32.

Besides the card, you have to plug an appropriate audio cable to <<#_ports_and_connectors,ZXDOS+ audio input>>. It must have a 3.5 mm stero jack on one side, and two mono output on the other side (one for each audio channel). The right audio mono is connected to the Miniduino.

If you hava a device that can use motor control, you can also use a cable with a 2.6 mm jack.

Copy the tape files (`TAP`, `TZX`, `O`, `P`, `CAS`, `TSX`, etc) to the first partition of the microSD card. They can be organized using folders or directories.

[TIP]
====
The player shows file and directory entries in the order stored in the internal FAT table, and not alphabetically. If you want to see them ordered, you have to reorder the microSD card structure with a utility like Fat Sorter for Windows, https://fatsort.sourceforge.io/[FATsort] for Linux and MacOS, https://www.luisrios.eti.br/public/en_us/projects/yafs/[YAFS], http://www.trustfm.net/software/utilities/SDSorter.phpp[SDSorter] or other.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Ïf the card is also being used with the <<#_pc_xt,PC XT>> core, **do not use any FAT reordering utility** as it may stop DOS from booting.
====

<<<

===== Use

Once the microSD card with the data files is inserted, it's turned on plugging in the included USB power cable.

[.text-center] 
image:img/MiniduinoLogo.jpg[pdfwidth=30%]

Pressing down the control button shows the options menu which can set the following:

- Baud Rate: Configures turbo speed baud rates when playing 4B blocks in MSX files (`CAS` and `TSX`)
- Motor Ctrl: Enable this option when a control cable is connected to a proper device (Amstrad, CPC, MSX, etc.)
- Converter (TSXCzxpUEFWS): Enables turbo loading `.CAS` and `.TSX` files, changes signal for Spectrum and Amstrad CPC files and/or change parity when playing Acorn Electron and BBC Micro `.UEF` files
- (Skip BLK)): To disable (Skip ON) or enable automatic pause when 2A blocks are found

When not inside the options menu, the control button is used as a four directional control joystick, which has two different behaviours depending whether the player is stopped or paused.

[.text-center] 
image:img/MiniduinoVersion.jpg[pdfwidth=30%]

When the player is stopped (file and directories browser):

- Up and Down move through the current files and directories list
- Left (Stop) goes one level up in the directory tree
- Right (Play/Pause) enters into a directory or, if the selection is a file, tries to play it

<<<

Once a file is being played, stop playing it with the left button (Stop) or pause using the right button (Play/Pause).

[.text-center] 
image:img/MiniduinoPlay.jpg[pdfwidth=30%]

When in pause (tape block browser:

- Up and Down mov through the tape block files alreadey played (useful for multiload titles, to load a previous level block, for example)
- Left (Stop) cancels the player and goes back to file and directory browser mode
- Right (Play/Pause) continues playing from the selected block
- Press down the control butto to enable or disable turbo mode for MSX

<<<

===== Making TZX or TSX files from other formats

While there are same tape file formats (Commodore, Camputers Lynx, etc.) not supported by Maxduino, there are some programs that can, wich can, more or less successfully, embed <<#_audio_file_conversion,audio data>> in a `TSX` or `TZX` file, which then can be used with Miniduino.

====== MakeTSX

You can use the following command with NataliaPC's https://github.com/nataliapc/makeTSX/releases[MakeTSX] to create a `TSX` file with embedded audio:

[source,shell]
----
...MakeTSX -b15 -wav audio_file.wav -tsx new_file.tsx
----

====== RetroConverter

Jorge Fuertes https://github.com/jorgefuertes/retroconverter/releases[RetroConverter] can create a `TZX` file with a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
...retroconv audio_file.wav new_file.tzx
----

<<<

===== Maxduino firmware upgrade

Maxduino firmware is periodically updated and improved. You can track the changes and improvements either at the  https://www.va-de-retro.com/foros/viewtopic.php?t=5541&start=9999[forums] or at the https://github.com/rcmolina/MaxDuino_BETA[GitHub project page]. To take advantage of this improvements, the Miniduino flash image must be flashed with the updated firmware version.

====== Environment setup

Firmware flashing is done from a computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) with https://www.arduino.cc/en/software[Arduino IDE] installed.

You have to install SDFat (1.1.4) software library selecting the menu option Program -> include library -> manage libraries

Minidiuno microcontroller support must also be added. This is done in two steps:

First, adding ARM Cortex M3 support from menu Tools -> board -> board manager, and installing "Arduino SAM boards (Cortex-M3)"

Then, you have to add STM32 microcontroller support, downloading the file available at https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/archive/master.zip[this link].

Extract the contents to the current user directory in 

[source,shell]
----
...Arduino/hardware/Arduino_STM32
----

If on Windows, install the USB device controller, running (with elevated privileges:

[source,shell]
----
 ...\drivers\win\install_drivers.bat
----

On Linux, install with root privileeges the necessary `udev` rules:

[source,shell]
----
...tools/linux/install.sh
----

On MacOS, if Miniduino does not appear as USB device in Arduino ID when plugged, it may be necessary to install https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki[libusb].

<<<

Finaly, when on Mac or Linux, the file `maple_upload` inside `Arduino_STM32` has to be changed with a text editor. Those lines do not work:

[source,shell]
----
if [ $# -eq 5 ]; then
    dfuse_addr="--dfuse-address $5"
else
    dfuse_addr=""
fi
----

And have to be changed into this:

[source,shell]
----
dfuse_addr=""
----

<<<

====== Upgrade

Once you have the environment ready, download the software from the https://github.com/rcmolina/MaxDuino_BETA[official repository in GitHub]

[NOTE]
====
Minduino player with STM32 microcontroller is only supported from 1.65 and up
====

Load the project file with Arduino IDE (for example `MaxDuino_v1.66.ino`).

Check in the file `userSTM32Config.h` that all logo entries are commented except for Miniduino and, if not, change them.

[source,c]
----
...
//#define tanque4
//#define tanque1
//#define dostanques
//#define cablemax
//#define sony
#define miniduino 
...
----

Connect the Miniduino device to the computer using the USB cable, and find the assigned port, normally with a name like "Maple Mini" (for example: COM5 Maple Mini)

Set the following options in menu "":

[source]
----
Board: Generic STM32F104C Series
Variant: STM32F104C8 (20k RAM, 64k Flash)
Upload Method: STM32duino bootloader
CPU Speed: 72Mhz (Normal)
Optimize: Smallest (default)
Port: <Previously identified port>
----

Finall, click on the firmware load button and wait for a few seconds while the project is compiled and loaded into the device.

If everything has been done correctly the Miniduino will restart and show on the screen the new firmware version.

<<<

=== RTC+I^2^S+PIzero addon

This hardware extra, has a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock[real-time clock (RTC)], a I^2^S UDA1334A chip and a 40-pin header where you can connect a Raspberry Pi computer which, the NexPI software, will work a as a <<#_zx_spectrum_next,ZX Spectrum Next core>> accelerator board.

==== I^2^S

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2S[I^2^S], also known as Inter-IC Sound, Integrated Interchip Sound, or IIS, is a standard for tramsmitting digital audio from one device to another. On ZXDOS+, this allows to send digital audio from a core to the addon, obtaining a better playback quality.

===== Supported cores

When writing this, the following cores have I^2^S support:

- <<#_zx_spectrum,ZX Spectrum>> (latest EXP27 and and Kyp 48K core versions)
- <<#_msx,MSX>> (since version 1.3)
- <<#_zx_spectrum_next,ZX Spectrum Next>> (latest versions)

[NOTE]
====
In the ZX Spectrum core, since the line is shared between I^2^S with Raspberry Pi audio, you can not use both at the same time, and you have to switch between them using the `F12` key (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+W` on gomaDOS+).
====

<<<

==== Raspberry Pi

===== NextPI

The NextPI distribution, based on diePI, includes the software that enables communications between the Raspberry Pi and the ZX Spectrum Next Core. The lates version is available to https://zx.xalior.com/NextPi/[download here].

Once downloaded, it has to be installed onto a a 1GB or more microSD card, that will be inserted to the  Raspberry Pi.

[TIP]
====
You can, with https://github.com/procount/pinn[software like PINN], install several operating systems to the card and then use the Raspberry Pi also for other things when not needed as an accelerator .
====

[NOTE]
====
The NextPI distribution has only been tested with a Raspberry Pi Zero. However, it has been seen to work, apparently, with other models (Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero W, etc.).
====

===== Connections

Although the 40-pin connector is the same, **the connection with this addon is not compatible with a Raspbery Pi Zero for ZX Spectrum Next**.

As you can see later, an addon compatible Raspbery Pi Zero has, among other things, the board side with the ports and the microSD adapter in the bottom, while the ZX Spectrum Next Version has them on the top.

[.text-center] 
image:img/pizeroback.jpg[pdfwidth=40%] image:img/pi_no_back.jpg[pdfwidth=40%]

[CAUTION]
====
A wrong connection of any of the pins with power (5V or 3,3V) can deal an irreversible damage, making one or more connections unusable.
====

[.text-center] 
image:img/pizeroaddon.jpg[pdfwidth=70%]

[NOTE]
====
When writing this manual, the latest NextPI version (0.99D RTM), doesn't need all the pins to work. It's enough to use:

[align="center",width="90%",%header,cols=3*] 
|===
|Name
|Pin
|Use
|`5V`
|`2` or `4`
|Power (optional)
|`GND`
|`6`
|Ground
|`UART TX (GPIO 14)`

|Audio Connection
|`PCM DIN (GPIO 20)`
|`38`
|Audio Connection
|`PCM DOUT (GPIO 21)`
|`40`
|Audio Connection
|===
====

[CAUTION]
====
When using any of the power pins **you must never connect simultaneously power to the Raspberry Pi and the ZXDOS+**.

You must take care to use a power source with only one of them, the ZXDOS+ or the addon connected Raspberry Pi. Whichever device with power will feed the other one. That is, it the ZXDOS+ has power, it will also give it to the Raspberry Pi, or else, if the Raspberry Pi is powered, it will feed also the ZXDOS+.
====

<<<

===== How to use from NextZXOS

To check if the serial connection with the Raspberry Pi works, you can use `Terminex`, a program available with the Next distribution in `/DEMOS/UART/TERMINEX/TERMINEX.SNX`. Once launched, you will see a screen looking like this:

[.text-center] 
image:img/terminex.png[pdfwidth=60%]

If your connection is good, and the Raspberry Pi has finished starting (it may take up to 1 or 2 minutes to be available), you should see a shell with the text:

[source,shell]
----
SUP>
----

If you see messages `Waiting for connection..` or `Waiting for DietPi..` it could be that the Raspberry Pi is still starting up, or that the serial connection isn't right.

In order to check the audio connection, you can try to load a `.TZX` file with the browser, or select an audio file (like `.MOD`, `XM`, `SND` or `SID`) and then check that, after a copy to the Raspberry Piy, you can hear audio (either a tape or music).

<<<

== Troubleshooting

=== Firmware images management

There are several tools with you can use to make and/or edit the contents of `ZX1`, `ZX2`, `ZXD` files.

==== zx123_tool

This is a tool to analyze, extract and inject data in SPI flash image files for ZX-Uno, ZXDOS and similar devices.

You need to have https://www.python.org/[Python 3] to use it. Depending on the operating system you may have to https://www.python.org/downloads/[install it].

Having Python 3, you only need to download the latest version of the tool from the official repository, following https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/releases/latest[this link].

Once extracted, you have to run from a shell the main script using Python 3. This may change depending on the operating system.

For example, on Windows, it's usually:

[source,shell]
----
py -3 zx123_tool.py
----

With other operating systems it normally is like:

[source,shell]
----
python3 ./zx123_tool.py
----

You also need a SPI flash image file. This can be obtained from within the Spectrum core in "root" mode, with one of the commands `back16m`, `backzx2` or `backzxd`. Once you have obtained the exteacted file from the microSD, you can "clean" it leaving only the Spectrum core and the first Spectrum ROM with a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -w -o FLASHempty.ZXD
----

Where `FLASH.ZXD` is the path to the original file and `FLASHempty.ZXD` is the path to the new "clean" file.

<<<

*List the contents of an image*

To see the contents of an image file named `FLASH.ZXD` (installed cores and some configuration info), you can use the command

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -l
----

To show the contents of the same file, including ZX Spectrun ROMs info:

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -l -r
----

*Change the BIOS of an image*

To change the BIOS inside a file named `FLASH.ZXD`, using the BIOS file named `FIRMWARE.ZXD`

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a BIOS,FIRMWARE.ZXD
----

You can, at the same time, modify some of the default parameters. For example, with the options; `-m` for video mode: 0 (PAL), 1 (NTSC) or 2 (VGA), `-k` for the keyboard layout: 0 (Auto), 1 (ES), 2 (EN) or 3 (Spectrum).

This way to change the BIOS of a file named `FLASH.ZXD`, using the BIOS file `FIRMWARE.ZXD`, and also set the video mode to VGA and the keyboard layout to Spectrum (for gomaDOS`+):

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a BIOS,FIRMWARE.ZXD -m 2 -k 3
----

There are also options to set the BIOS boot delay time, the default core or the default Spectrum ROM. See the  https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/[documentation] for more info.

<<<

*Add a Spectrum ROM to an image*

To add a Spectrum ROM file named `48.rom`, with the name `Spec48` and using the slot number 5, you can use a command like:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a ROM,5,xdnlh17,Spec48,48.rom
----

See the  https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/[documentation] for all the possible options when adding a Spectrum ROM.

Amongst the information you give when adding a ROM, there are some flags used to tell which hardware options, etc, you want to have enabled or disabled when loading the ROM, as shown in this table:

[align="center",width="70%",%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|`i`
|Keyboard issue 3 enabled (instead of issue 2)
|`c`
|Disable memory contention
|`d`
|Enable DivMMC
|`n`
|Enable NMI DivMMC (esxdos Menu)
|`p`
|Use Pentagon Timings
|`t`
|Use 128K timings
|`s`
|Disable DivMMC and ZXMMC ports
|`m`
|Enable Timex Horizontal MMU
|`h`
|Disable ROM high bit (1FFD bit 2)
|`l`
|Disable ROM low bit (7FFD bit 4)
|`1`
|Disable 1FFD port (+2A/3 paging)
|`7`
|Disable 7FFD port (128K paging)
|`2`
|Disable TurboSound (secondary AY chip)
|`a`
|Disable AY chip
|`r`
|Disable Radastanian mode
|`x`
|Disable Timex mode
|`u`
|Disable ULAPlus
|===

<<<

*Install a Core to an image*

For example, to install a core in space 3, from a file named `NEXT.ZXD`, with the name `Spectrum Next`, use a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a 'CORE,3,Spectrum Next,NEXT.ZXD'
----

If you want also to set the core as the default, use a command like:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a 'CORE,3,Spectrum Next,NEXT.ZXD' -c 3
----

*Change esxdos ROM of an image*

Just like the BIOS firmware, you can install a ROM esxdos file, with a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a esxdos,ESXMMC.BIN
----

*Mix several actions in one line*

Please do note that you can add several actions in one command line. For example, to "clean" an image file named `FLASH.ZXD`, creating a new one named `FLASHnew.ZXD`, installing the BIOS from the file `FIRMWARE.ZXD`, set up video mode to VGA, the keyboard in Spectrum mode, add a Spectrum ROM file `48.rom`, with the name `Spec48` while ussing slot number 5, install a core at space 3, from a file named `NEXT.ZXD`, with the name `Spectrum Next`, as default core:

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -w -o FLASHnew.ZXD -a BIOS,FIRMWARE.ZXD -m 2 -k 3 -a ROM,5,xdnlh17,Spec48,48.rom -a CORE,3,SpecNext,NEXT.ZXD -c 3
----

<<<

=== Firmware recovery

Sometimes (e.g. when installing an experimental core or when upgrading the ZX Spectrum Core or the BIOS) it may happen that the ZXDOS+ stops booting. The board LEDs are on, but there is no display, and it doesn't do anything when trying the different key combinations to access BIOS setup, etc.

When this happens, there are several recovery methods that let you install again the firmware.

==== JTAG cable connections

Later, in some of the recovery steps, when talking about jump wires or USB-Blaster connections to ZXDOS, you can use these images as reference.

[.text-center]

. Connect USB-Blaster or jump wires if using GPIO. In this case, open the ZXDOS+ or gomaDOS+ case and, <<#_jtag_cable_connections,as explained before>> connect the FPGA JTAG lines (`TMS`, `TDI`, `TDO`, `TCK` and `GND`), using the wires, to the Raspberry Pi https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPIO[GPIO] pins.

Is using a GPIO connection, take note of the chosen pins, making sure that `GND` is connected with `GND`.

[.text-center] 
image:img/gpio.jpg[pdfwidth=70%]

In this example, the `31`, `33`, `35`, `37` and `39` pins will be used (corresponding to `GPIO #6`, `GPIO #13`, `GPIO #19`, `GPIO #26` and `GND`), like this:

[align="center",width="50%",%header,cols=3*] 
|===
|ZXDOS+ JTAG
|GPIO
|Raspberry Pi Pin
|`TMS`
|GPIO#6
|`31`
|`TDI`
|GPIO#13
|`33`
|`TDO`
|GPIO#19
|`35`
|`TCK`
|GPIO#26
|`37`
|`GND`
|GND
|`39`

[start=4]
. Copy to the Raspberry Pi the file named `recovery.zxd.bit` previously downloaded from the https://github.com/zxdos/zxdos-plus/raw/master/lx25/FLASH.zip[official repository]. For our example, it will be at `/home/pi/zxdosplus/unbrick/`

. If using GPIO, make a copy of Open OCD configuration file, to the same directory where `recovery.zxd.bit` is.

[source,shell]
----
cp /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/raspberrypi2-native.cfg /home/pi/zxdosplus/unbrick/
----

<<<

[start=6]
. For GPIO connection, edit `raspberrypi2-native.cfg` copy, updating `bcm2835gpio_jtag_nums` (uncommenting, if necessary), with your JTAG and GPIO connection numbers, at the line `bcm2835gpio_jtag_nums`. For our example:

[source]
----
# Header pin numbers: 37 31 33 35
bcm2835gpio_jtag_nums 26 6 13 19
----

[start=7]
. Comment, if it wasnt't already, the line `bcm2835gpio_swd_nums` (not necessary for USB-Blaster connection):

[source]
----
#bcm2835gpio_swd_nums 11 25
----

[start=8]
. Add, to the end of the file, the line `adapter speed 250` (again, not necessary for USB-Blaster):

[source]
----
adapter speed 250
----

[start=9]
. Turn on the ZXDOS+ or gomaDOS+.

. Make sure that, on the Raspberry Pi, we are in the directory where `recovery.zxd.bit` is, and execute the command that loads the BIOS on recovery mode, using the path to the previously edited `raspberrypi2-native.cfg`.

For GPIO connection: 

[source,shell]
----
cd /home/pi/zxdosplus/unbrick
sudo openocd -f /home/pi/zxdosplus/unbrick/raspberrypi2-native.cfg -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/cpld/xilinx-xc6s.cfg -c "init; xc6s_program xc6s.tap; pld load 0 recovery.zxd.bit ; exit"
----

For USB-Blaster connection:

[source,shell]
----
sudo openocd -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/altera-usb-blaster.cfg  -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/cpld/xilinx-xc6s.cfg -c "init; xc6s_program xc6s.tap; pld load 0 recovery.zxd.bit ; exit"
----

[start=11]
. If all goes well, we will see that the FPGA LED change their state and the BIOS is shown on the display.

If there is no image on the display, press `Scroll Lock` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+G` on gomaDOS+) to switch between RGB and VGA modes, just in case the recovery BIOS did start in the wrong mode for our setup.

[.text-center] 
image:img/recovery.png[pdfwidth=70%]

[start=12]
. Insert in the ZXDOS+ the microSD card formatted as FAT16 o FAT32, and with the `FLASH.ZXD` file https://github.com/zxdos/zxdos-plus/raw/master/lx25/FLASH.zip[downloaded previously].

. If using a USB-Blaster connection, unplug the connector.

<<<

[start=14]
. Select the option `Upgrade Flash from SD`. Press Enter, choose `Yes`, and press Enter again to start the Flash writing process.

[WARNING]
====
This process can't be undone, and it will replace all the previously installed cores, the BIOS, the ZX Spectrum ROMs and their configuration with the data in the image file.
====

[NOTE]
====
Ususally, the recovery image is set to use a PS/2 keyboard so, for a gomaDOS+, some key combinations, like `Caps Shift + 5`, etc may not work. In this case, you have to change the keyboard mode to `PC XT`(`Caps Shift + Symbol Shift + U` and then `9`), to make them work temporarily.
====

<<<

[start=15]
. After some minutes, the process will end, and, after turning the ZXDOS+ off and on, it should start fine.

[NOTE]
====
If no image is shown, press again `Scroll Lock` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+G` on gomaDOS+) to switch between RGB and VGA modes. In this case, you should have to enter the BIOS and change <<#_advanced, the right advanced setting>> that matches your display.
====

[NOTE]
====
For a gomaDOS+, since the recovery image uses a PS/2 configuration as default, follow this steps to set up the BIOS correctly:

. If you see no image, switch between RGB and VGA mode (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+G`)
. Change to `PC XT` keyboard mode (`Caps Shift + Symbol Shift + U` and then `9`)
. Reboot gomaDOS+ without losing the temporary keyboard mode (`Caps Shift + Symbol Shift + B`)
. Quickly, press `Caps Shift + 1`
. Again, if there's no image, switch between RGB and VGA mode (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+G`)
. Navigate through BIOS and turno on these options:
- `Advanced` -> `Keyboard Layout`: `Spectrum`
- `Advanced` -> `Video`: `VGA`  (only if there was no image)
. Save changes:
- `Exit` -> `Save changes and exit`
. Completely turn off gomaDOS` and turn it on again
