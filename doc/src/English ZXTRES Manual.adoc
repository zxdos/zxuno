== Introduction

ZXTRES, ZXTRES+ and ZXTRES++ are the continuation of https://zxuno.speccy.org[ZX-Uno] a hardware and software project based on an FPGA board programmed to work like a ZX Spectrum computer, and created by the ZX-Uno team: Superfo, AVillena, McLeod, Quest and Hark0.

Over time, the project has been growing, and now it is possible to use different software configurations (cores), which work like different systems than the ZX Spectrum, and you can choose to start the ZXTRES with the desired configuration among all those available.

ZXTRES official web page is .

Most of the functions and features of ZXTRES, ZXTRES+ and ZXTRES++ and are the same, so this document will generally talk about ZXTRES, indicating the differences where necessary.

=== Aknowledgements

A lot of the content of this manual is based on information previously shared:

- At https://www.forofpga.es/[foroFPGA]
- At https://www.zxuno.com/forum/[ZX-Uno forum]
- Several existing FAQ, mostly the original version https://uto.speccy.org/zxunofaq.html[by @uto_dev], and the latest one http://desubikado.sytes.net/zx-uno-faq-version-desubikado/[by @desUBIKado]
- Official Telegram Channels for https://t.me/zxuno[ZX-Uno], https://t.me/zxdosfpga[ZXDOS] and https://t.me/zxtresfpga[ZXTRES]

=== Initial Setup

In order to be able to set up and use a ZXTRES you need, at least, the following:

- A USB charger, a TV or other device that provides USB power (5VDC and, at least, 1A). The connector is a coaxial jack "barrel" plug of 5.5 mm outer diameter and 2.1 mm inner diameter, with positive polarity (center positive)
- A DisplayPort, VGA or RGB cable and compatible display (the RGB connection can also be used with a VGA to SCART adapter and connected to compatible TVs).
- PS/2 keyboard

[TIP]
====
It is important that the source has stable voltage and sufficient current, or erratic behavior (keyboard or DisplayPort failure, etc.) may occur. Some keyboards or peripherals might need a similar power supply but with 2 amps or more.

[.text-center]
image:img/powerConnector.png[scaledwidth=20%]
====

In order to take advantage of its full potential, you may also have:

- A microSD card, 32GB capacity or less
- PC speakers to connect to the audio output, or a stereo jack converter to two red/white RCA connectors to connect to the TV
- At least one standard Atari joystick, such as a Megadrive DB9 gamepad
- A PS/2 mouse
- An audio cable with a stereo 3.5 mm jack on one side, and both audio channels split into two mono outputs on the other side, if you want to use an audio player and/or recorder, like, for example, a Miniduino (<<#_miniduino,see more info later>>)., a PC/Mac/Raspberry PI, etc. or a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape[cassette tape] recorder/player. The right sound channel is used as input (EAR) and the left channel can be used as output (MIC).

[NOTE]
====
FAT16 partitions have a maximum size of 4GB
====

[CAUTION]
====
When naming a partition which will be used with esxdos, it's important not to use the same of any directory inside, or an access error will happen when trying to see the contents (e.g. do not name the partition as `BIN`, `SYS` or `TMP`).
====

[TIP]
====
The Spectrum core can also have <<#_microsd_advanced_format_3e,the first partition in +3DOS format, and then the second one in FAT16 or FAT32 format>> to use with a +3e ROM.
====

<<<

===== Windows

For simple configurations, and cards of the right size (less than 2GB for FAT16 or less than 32GB for FAT32), you can use https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/[the official formatting tool of the SD Association ].

For other, more complex, configurations, and depending on operating system version, you may use the command line tool `diskpart` or Windows Disk Managemente GUI.

For example, to format a card, shown as disk 6 when executing `list disk` from `diskpart`, with only one FAT16 partition (if the card size is less than 4GB):

[source]
----
select disk 6
clean
create part primary
active
format FS=FAT label=ZXTRES
exit
----

To create two FAT 16 partitions (e.g. to use MSX core) and have the rest of space as another FAT32 partition (for cards more than 8GB in size):

[source]
----
select disk 6
clean
create part primary size=4000
set id = 06
active
format fs=FAT label=ZXTRES quick
create part primary size=4000
format fs=FAT label=EXTRA quick
create part primary
format fs=FAT32 label=DATA quick
exit
----

To create one FAT32 4GB partition (e.g. to use with Amstrad CPC 6128 core), and then have the rest of space available as a second FAT32 partition (for cards more than 4GB in size):

[source]
----
select disk 6
clean
create part primary size=4000
set id = 0b
active
format fs=FAT32 label=ZXTRES unit=4k quick
create part primary
format fs=FAT32 label=EXTRA quick
exit
----

<<<

===== MacOS

For simple configurations, and cards of the right size (less than 2GB for FAT16 or less than 32GB for FAT32), you can use https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/[the official formatting tool of the SD Association ] or Disk Utility, which is included with the operating system.

In other case, you should use the command line.

For example, to format a card, shown as `disk6`, with only one FAT16 partition (if the card size is less than 2GB):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR "MS-DOS FAT16" ZXTRES R
----

To split it into two FAT16 partitions of the same size (if the card size is 4GB or less):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR "MS-DOS FAT16" ZXTRES 50% "MS-DOS FAT16" EXTRA 50%
----

To create two FAT 16 partitions (e.g. to use MSX core) and have the rest of space as another FAT32 partition (for cards more than 8GB in size):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR %DOS_FAT_16% ZXTRES 4G %DOS_FAT_16% EXTRA 4G "MS-DOS FAT32" DATA R
sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 -v ZXTRES -c 128 /dev/rdisk6s1
sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 -v EXTRA -b 4096 -c 128 /dev/rdisk6s2
----

[NOTE]
====
`diskutil` cannot create FAT16 partitions which are bigger than 2G and also format them. That's why, in this example, after only creating the partitions, we have to format them.
====

<<<

To create one FAT32 4GB partition (e.g. to use with Amstrad CPC 6128 core), and then have the rest of space available as a second FAT32 partition (for cards of more than 4GB):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR "MS-DOS FAT32" ZXTRES 4G "MS-DOS FAT32" EXTRA R
----

[NOTE]
====
In this example, since the partition has a size of exactly 4G, MacOS will use a cluster size of 4096, which is the one neede for the Amstrad CPC 6128 core. For a smaller size, you may have to format again the first partition with some commands like these:

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
newfs_msdos -F 32 -v ZXTRES -b 4096 /dev/rdisk6s1
----
====

[TIP]
====
The Spotlight feature in MacOS you to search the items on the microSD card, creating a number of hidden files. You can disable the indexing with these commands (assuming that the SD partition is named `ZXTRES`):

[source,shell]
----
mdutil -i off /Volumes/ZXTRES
cd /Volumes/ZXTRES
rm -rf .{,_.}{fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes}
mkdir .fseventsd
touch .fseventsd/no_log .metadata_never_index .Trashes
cd -
----
====

<<<

===== Linux

There are a lot of tools for Linux that can format and/or partition a microSD card (`fdisk`, `parted`, `cfdisk`, `sfdisk` or `GParted` to name a few). It should only be taken into account that the partition scheme must always be MBR, and the first partition (the one that will be used for esxdos) must be primary partition.

For example, to format a card, shown as `sdc`, with only one FAT16 partition (if the card size is less than 4GB):

[source,shell]
----
sudo fdisk --compatibility=dos /dev/sdc
----

[source]
----

=== Keyboard

==== PS/2 keyboard

The keyboard map (physical keys of the keyboard assignment to the keystrokes that are presented to the different cores) is changed using the `Advanced` menu of the BIOS. There are three different maps to choose from: Spanish (default), English, and Spectrum (advanced).

You can also change it using the `keymap` utility. Inside `/bin` you have to create a directory named `keymaps` and copy inside the keyboard map files that you want to use. For example, to switch to the US map you have to write `.keymap us` from esxdos.

For the map to be preserved after a master reset, it has to be selected as `Default` in the BIOS.

For more information, see https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=208[this message in the ZX-Uno forum].

==== Special keys and buttons

Special keys which can be used during startup:

- `F2` Enter BIOS setup
- `Caps Lock` or `Cursor down` or, if a joystick is connected, pressing `down`: Core selection menu
- `Esc`, or if a joystick with two or more fire buttons is connected, pressing the 2nd fire button: ZX Spectrum core ROM selection menu
- `R`: Loads the Spectrum core ROM in "real" mode, disabling esxdos, new graphics modes, etc.
- `/` (numeric keyboard): Load the default ZX Spectrum core ROM in "root" mode
- Number from `1` to `9`: Load the core in the flash location corresponding to that number. On the latest BIOS versions, `9` is used to load the core installed to the temporary slot used by the <<#_bob_fossil_browser,ZX3 plugin>>

Special keys that can be used while running the main core (ZX Spectrum):

- `Esc`: BREAK
- `F2`: Edit
- `F5`: NMI
- `F7`: Play or pause when playing .PZX files
- `F8`: Rewind .PZX file to the previous mark
- `F10`: Graph
- `F12`: Turbo Boost. Speeds up CPU to 28MHz
- `Ctrl+Alt+Backspace`: Hard reset. Backspace is the delete key, located in the top-right portion of the keyboard, above `Enter`
- `Ctrl+Alt+Supr`: Soft reset
- `Scroll Lock`: Switches between RGB and VGA video modes. DisplayPort is always enabled
- `Home`: Switches between the several DisplayPort deinterlacing modes (Blend, Off, Auto and On). This option is only available for ZXTRES+ and ZXTRES++ core versions
- `End`: Select one of the monochrome color modes

<<<

=== esxdos

https://esxdos.org/index.html[esxdos] is a firmware for the DivIDE/DivMMC hardware interfaces (which ZXTRES implements). This allows access to storage devices such as a microSD card. It includes commands similar to those of UNIX, although to use them you must precede them with a period, for example `.ls`,` .cd`, `.mv`, etc.

For it to work, it is necessary to include the corresponding files in the first partition of the microSD card.

At the time of writing this document, the version included with ZXTRES is 0.8.9, and it can be downloaded from the official website https://www.esxdos.org/files/esxdos086.zip[at this link].

Once downloaded and extracted, you have to copy the directories `BIN`, `SYS` and `TMP`, and all of their content, to the root of first partition of the microSD card.

If everything has been done correctly, when you turn on the ZXTRES Spectrum core, you will see how esxdos detects the card and loads the necessary components to work.

[.text-center]
image:./img/esxdos.png[scaledwidth=70%]

<<<

It is also recommended to add the specific esxdos commands for ZXTRES. These can be obtained from the project source page (https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/SD[here], https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/[here] and https://guest:zxuno@svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/software/upgrade[here]), and are as follows:

=== BIOS

[.text-center]
image:./img/boot_zxtres.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Pressing the `F2` key during boot will access the BIOS setup. The BIOS firmware is the first program that runs when the ZXTRES is turned on. The main purpose of BIOS is to start and test the hardware and load one of the installed cores.

Using left and right cursor keys, you can navigate through the BIOS setup screens. With up and down keys you can choose the different elements of each screen and, with the `Enter` key, it is possible to activate and choose the options for each of these. `Esc` key is used to close open option windows without applying any action.

Other special keys which can be used during startup:

- `F2` Enter BIOS setup
- `Caps Lock` or `Cursor down` or, if a joystick is connected, pressing `down`: Core selection menu
- `Esc`, or if a joystick with two or more fire buttons is connected, pressing the 2nd fire button: ZX Spectrum core ROM selection menu
- `R`: Loads the Spectrum core ROM in "real" mode, disabling esxdos, new graphics modes, etc.
- `/` (numeric keyboard): Load the default ZX Spectrum core ROM in "root" mode
- Number from `1` to `9`: Load the core in the flash location corresponding to that number.  On the latest BIOS versions, `9` is used to load the core installed to the temporary slot used by the <<#_bob_fossil_browser,ZX3 plugin>>

<<<

==== Main

[.text-center]
image:img/bios.png[scaledwidth=70%]

In the first configuration screen, in addition to being able to run several tests, you can define the default behavior for the following:

- Boot Timer: Sets how long the boot screen is available (or hiding it completely)
- Check CRC: Check ROM integrity when loading (more secure) or bypassing it (faster)
- Keyboard
- Timing: ULA Behaviour (48K, 128K, Pentagon Modes)
- Contended
- DivMMC
- DivMMC NMI Support
- New Graphic Modes Support (ULAPlus, Timex, Radastan)

More technical information can be found on https://www.zxuno.com/wiki/index.php/ZX_Spectrum[de ZX-Uno Wiki].

==== ROMs

[.text-center]
image:img/bios2.png[scaledwidth=70%]

The second screen shows the installed ZX Spectrum ROMs. You can reorder (Move Up, Move Down), rename or delete each of them, as well as choose the one that will be loaded by default at startup (Set Active ).

==== Upgrade

[.text-center]
image:img/bios3_zxtres.png[scaledwidth=70%]

_Upgrade_ screen is used to perform the different updates of the Flash memory content: esxdos, BIOS, Cores, etc. (see <<#_upgrade,the section corresponding to upgrades>> for more information).

==== Advanced

[.text-center]
image:img/bios5_zxtres.png[scaledwidth=70%]

The Advanced configuration screen is used to edit the following settings:

- Keyboard layout (Keyb Layout): See <<#_keyboard,the corresponding section>> for more information)
- Joystick behavior connected to the right port and also the emulated joystick using the numeric keypad (Joy Keypad): Kempston, Sinclair Joystick 1, Sinclair Joystick 2, Protek, Fuller or simulate the keys `Q`,` A`, `O`,` P`, `Space` and `M`
- Behavior of a joystick connected to the left port (Joy DB9): Kempston, Sinclair Joystick 1, Sinclair Joystick 2, Protek, Fuller or simulate the keys `Q`,` A`, `O`,` P`, `Space` and `M`
- Video output: PAL, NTSC or VGA (DisplayPort is always active)
- Scanline simulation: Enabled or Disabled
- VGA horizontal frequency: 50, 51, etc.
- CPU speed: Normal (1x) or accelerated (2X, 3X, etc.)
- Csync: Spectrum or PAL

<<<

==== Exit

[.text-center]
image:img/bios6.png[scaledwidth=70%]

Finally, from the last screen you can:

- Exit BIOS configuration saving changes (in some cases a power reset is also neeeded)
- Discard changes and exit
- Save changes without exiting
- Discard Changes

== ZX Spectrum

The main core is the one implementing a ZX Spectrum computer. This core is special, and it cannot be replaced for another that is not a ZX Spectrum, since the ZXTRES uses it for its operation.

These are some of its main characteristics:

- ZX Spectrum 48K, 128K, Pentagon and Chloe 280SE implementation
- ULA with ULAplus, Timex and Radastan modes (including hardware scroll and selectable palette group)
- Ability to disable memory contention (for Pentagon 128 compatibility)
- Ability to choose the keyboard behavior (issue 2 or issue 3)
- Possibility to choose the timing of the ULA (48K, 128K or Pentagon)
- Control of screen framing, configurable for type of timing, and possibility to choose between original Spectrum synchronisms or progressive PAL standard.
- Timex horizontal MMU support with HOME, DOC and EXT banks in RAM.
- Programmable raster interruption in line number, for any TV line.
- Possibility of activating/deactivating memory bank management registers, for better compatibility with each implemented model
- Ability to activate / deactivate the devices incorporated into the core to improve compatibility with certain programs
- ZXMMC and DIVMMC support for + 3e, esxdos and compatible firmwares
- Turbo Sound support
- SpecDrum support
- Each channel A, B, C of the two AY-3-8912, beeper and SpecDrum chips can be directed to the left, right, both or neither outputs, allowing the implementation of configurations such as ACB, ABC, etc.
- Real joystick and keyboard joystick support with Kempston, Sinclair 1 and 2, Cursor, Fuller and QAOPSpcM protocol.
- Turbo mode support at 7MHz, 14MHz, 28MHz
- Keyboard support (PS/2 protocol) and user-configurable mapping from within Spectrum itself.
- PS/2 mouse support emulating the Kempston Mouse protocol.
- Possibility of video output in RGB 15kHz, VGA and DisplayPort.
- User selectable vertical refresh rate to improve compatibility with VGA monitors
- Multicore boot support: from the Spectrum you can select an address of the SPI Flash and the FPGA will load a core from there
- Different colour modes including monochrome
- I^2^S and DeltaSigma audio output
- MIDI Support (General MIDI) via middleboard
- `PZX` file loading from SD emulating tape audio
- Multiple deinterlacing modes for DisplayPort including an option to blend the colours. This is only available for ZXTRES+ and ZXTRES++ core versions

<<<

=== ROMs

The ZX Spectrum core can be initialized using different ROM versions (48K, 128K, Plus 2, etc.). These are stored in the flash memory of the ZXTRES, and you can choose which one to load by pressing the `Esc` key during boot. You can also define the ROM that you want to load by default using the BIOS setup.

See the <<#_roms_3,updates section>> for more information on how to expand or modify the ROMs stored in flash memory.

==== DerbyPro

https://www.facebook.com/groups/DerbyPro[DerbyPro or Derby{pp}] is an enhanced firmware ROM for the ZX Spectrum, based on v1.4 of the Derby development ROM. The Spectrum 128 (codename "Derby") was a Spanish machine commissioned by Investronica and launched in 1985. It came with a keypad that provided additional editing keys. In 1986, the UK version came out with a simplified version of 128 BASIC and no keypad. Derby++ is developed from the Spanish ROM to include the benefits of both versions, without the drawbacks, and support for new hardware developments.

You can download the ROM, a user manual and other files from the https://www.facebook.com/groups/DerbyPro[official Facebook Public Group].

Since it is a 64K ROM with support for new hardware, these flags can be used when <<#_zx123_tool,adding it to the SPI flash>>:

[align="center",width="60%",%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Flag
|Meaning
|`d`
|Enable DivMMC
|`n`
|Enable NMI DivMMC (esxdos Menu)
|`t`
|Use 128K timings
|===

<<<

==== CargandoLeches

CargandoLeches is a set of ZX Spectrum ROMs that started as a project to load games in any Spectrum model 15-20x faster. No tape is needed, but a digital audio source, as a computer, mobile device, MP3 player, etc. The new ROM detects the loading method and reverts to the original ROM code if needed. This is handled transparently, with no user or program intervention.

Since version 2.0 the project changed from a single ROM to more, each one with different options. This way, you can choose a different mix of options that may include:

- Ultrafast loading
- Reset & Play (After a sofware reset of the core, the system is ready to load from tape)
- POKE editor
- Enable or disable Sinclair BASIC token expansion

The whole ROM set is available to download from the repository in GitHub https://github.com/antoniovillena/CargandoLeches/tree/master/binaries[here].

Depending on which ROM you choose, the flags when <<#_zx123_tool,adding to the SPI flash>> may vary. For example, for the ROM `48le_ea_re_po` (with all features enabled), these flags can be used (we cannot enable NMI DivMMC since the POKE editor will use it):

[align="center",width="60%",%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Flag
|Meaning
|`d`
|Enable DivMMC
|`h`
|Disable ROM high bit (1FFD bit 2)
|`l`
|Disable ROM low bit (7FFD bit 4)
|`x`
|Disable Timex mode
|===

===== POKEs

When using a ROM with POKE option enabled:

. Once the game is loaded, after pressing NMI (`F5`) a field will appear in the upper left corner of the screen
. Enter the POKE address and press `Enter`
. Enter the POKE value and press `Enter` again
. Repeat steps 2. and 3. until all the desired POKEs are entered. To finish and return to the game, press `Enter` twice

<<<

===== Preparing ultrafast loading tapes

The ROMs with ultrafast loading enabled, need special tape audio data which is made from normal loading `TAP` files, without protections or turbo loading.

In order to create an ultrafast loading tape you need `leches` and `CgLeches` command line utilities. Those can be obtained, for Windows, from the
https://github.com/antoniovillena/CargandoLeches/tree/master/binaries[official repository]. You can also obtain an unofficial version for MacOS from https://github.com/kounch/CargandoLeches/tree/master/binaries/MacOS[this other repository].

In any other case, you can compile from the https://github.com/antoniovillena/CargandoLeches[source code at the official repository]. For example, in Linux, to compile using `gcc` you only need these commands:

[source,shell]
----
gcc leches.c -o leches
gcc CgLeches.c -o CgLeches
----

To create an ultrafast loading tape you have to use the `CgLeches` command from a terminal, giving, at least, the path to the original `TAP` file and also to the new file to create (`WAV` or `TZX`). There are also some other optional parameters, like the loading speed, between 0 and 7 (where 0 is fastest but also more incompatible), if you want to create a mono or stereo file (when making a `WAV`), and more.

Thus, to make a `WAV` file with an ultrafast loading tape from the file `Valley.tap`, with loading speed 5, you could type:

[source,shell]
----
(...) CgLeches Valley.tap Valley.wav 5
----

This way, the file `Valley.wav` can be played from a computer or another device and load using the ROM (see the section about <<#_loading_from_tape,loading from tape>> for more info).

[WARNING]
====
Due to hardware limitations, `TZX` files made with `CgLeches` do not work with a <<#_miniduino,Miniduino>>, although they usually work with <<#_playtzx,`PlayTZX`>>.

==== SE Basic IV

https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4[SE Basic IV] is a free open-source Z80 interpreter for Microsoft BASIC. SE Basic IV is designed to run on the https://www.patreon.com/chloe280se[Chloe 280SE] but it can also run on ZX-Uno and similar computers.

SE Basic was originally conceived as a new firmware for the https://sinclair.wiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_SE[ZX Spectrum SE]. The earliest versions of SE Basic were patches applied to the original ZX Spectrum ROM, but later versions have been rewritten based on the https://groups.google.com/g/comp.sys.sinclair/c/F90HbKTDkRk[open source TS1000 / ZX81 improved ROM].

Version 3, also known as https://zxdesign.itch.io/opense[OpenSE BASIC], is still maintained as an open source replacement firmware for the Spectrum. Itâs https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/opense-basic[included in the main Debian repository] for use with emulators.

Version IV is a fork of the previous version, done because there was no room left to add new features to the 16K ROM. The initial release (4.0 Anya) added another 16K ROM with support for Timex hi-res mode. The syntax was still largely Sinclair BASIC compatible at this point. Version 4.2 was rebuilt specifically for the Chloe 280SE, dropping support for legacy devices such as tape, adding full compatibility and integrated support for the esxdos kernel, and migrating to Microsoft BASIC syntax.

While it shares a common code base with many versions of Sinclair BASIC (the TS1000 ROM), it differs from them in significant ways:

- Code page (8-bit ASCII) support.
- Error message localization.
- 38 additional tokens.
- Standard terminal display (80 x 24).
- Terminal character entry (CTRL, META).
- Keyboard buffer.
- Full sized keyboard support.

The main differences from Microsoft BASIC are:

- Token abbreviation.
- On-entry syntax checking.
- Typically, brackets are optional.
- Motorola style number entry:
  % â binary
  @ â octal
  $ â hexadecimal
- Always-on expression evaluation.
- Separate logical and bitwise operators.
- Automatic data typing.

=== microSD advanced format (+3e)

ZX Spectrum +3e is one ROM that can be used with ZX Spectrum core. This is an improved Sinclair ZX Spectrum +3, wich can use hard disks or memory cards.

+3e uses its own partition format (called IDEDOS), to split de hard disk into several partitions to store data. ROM version 1.28 and later can share IDEDOS partitions with MBR partitions. In other case, you must reserve the whole card for IDEDOS partitions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following partition scheme can only be used with ZX Spectrum core.
====

[TIP]
====
Each partition in IDEDOS can be between 1 and 16 Megabytes (16 million bytes) in size, and each disk can have between 1 and 65535 partitions. This means that the maximum space used in a card is about 1 TB.
====

This is one method to split a card into two or three parts, with the first partition IDEDOS (1GB), the second one FAT16 (4GB) and the third one FAT32 (using the remaining space in the card).

exsdos and other programs can be installed into the second partition <<#_esxdos,as explained earlier>>.

==== Windows

You can use Windows Disk Management utility. The steps are:

. Remove all partitions from the card

. Create a new extended partition, using the desired space for IDEDOS

. Create a primary partition, 4GB in size, and format as FAT16

. Optionally, create another primary partition using the remaining space and format as FAT32

<<<

==== MacOS

You will have to use the command line. The first task is to find out which device is the disk to format:

[source,shell]
----
diskutil list
----

For this example, it will be disk 6:

[source]
----
(...)
/dev/disk6 (external, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER

==== +3e

Once the microSD card is ready to use, you can start Spectrum core with a +3e ROM and format the IDEDOS part.

The first step is determine the disk geometry. With the cart inserted into the ZXTRES, type the command:

[source,basic]
----
CAT TAB
----

This will give a result showing the number of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder-head-sector[cylinders, heads and sectors].

Whith this info, we estimate the size of our partition, using cylinders. For example, if the number of cylinders is 32768, and we want to use 1GB of a 16GB card, the number of cylinders needes would be 32768/16=2048. This way, the IDEDOS partition can be formatted using that number:

[source,basic]
----
FORMAT TO 0,100,2048
----

The first value (`0`) is the drive to use (the first one), the second value is the maximum number of IDEDOS partitions, and the third one yis the number of cylinders to use.

Once formatted, you can create new partitions. For example, to create a 16MB partition with the name "Software", another 4GB partition named "Swap" (to use as swap) and another one name "Utils", 8MB in size:

[source,basic]
----
NEW DATA "Software",16
NEW EXP "Swap1",4
NEW DATA "Utils",8
----

=== esxdos commands

==== Basic Guide

There are two different kind of esxdos commands, the so-called "DOT" commands, which, as the name suggests, begin with a period, and the commands that are extensions to the existing ones in BASIC.

The main "DOT" commands are the following:

- `128`: Para enter 128K mode from within 48K mode
- `cd`: Change current working directory
- `chmod`: Change file attributes
- `cp`: Copy a file
- `divideo`: Play a DivIDEo (.DVO) video file
- `drives`: Show currently available drives
- `dskprobe`: Utility which shows low level content of an storage device
- `dumpmem`: Can dump RAM memory content to a file
- `file`: Tries to recognize the type of data contained in a file (like the UNIX command)
- `gramon`: Monitor to search graphics, sprites, fonts, etc. in RAM memory
- `hexdump`: Shows the contents of a file using hexadecimal notation
- `hexview`: Allow to see and navigate through the contents os a file using hexadecimal notation
- `launcher`: Creates a shortcut (launcher) to open directly a TAP file
- `ls`: Show the content of a directory
- `lstap`: Show the content of a .TAP file
- `mkdir`: Create a directory
- `mktrd`: Create a .TRD disk file
- `more`: Show the content of a text file
- `mv`: Move a file
- `partinfo`: Show partition information of an storage device
- `playpt3`: Play .PT3 music file
- `playsqt`: Play .SQT music file
- `playstc`: Play .STC music file
- `playtfm`: Play .TFC music file
- `playwav`: Play .WAV audio file
- `rm`: Remove a file or a directory
- `snapload`: Load snapshot file
- `speakcz`: Reads text aloud using czech pronunciation
- `tapein`: Mounts a .TAP file so that it can be used then from BASIC using LOAD sentence
- `tapeout`: Mount a .TAP file so that it can be used then from BASIC using SAVE sentence
- `vdisk`: Mount a .TRD disk file to use with the TR-DOS environment (once all the drives have been mounted, you can enter TR-DOS emulation by typing: `RANDOMIZE USR 15616`)

Some BASIC extended commands are:

- `GO TO` to change the current drive and/or directory (e.g.: `GO TO hd1` or `GO TO hd0"games"`)
- `CAT` to show the content of a drive
- `LOAD` to lad a file from a drive (BASIC Program, SCREEN, CODE, etc. for example `LOAD *"Screen.scr" SCREEN$`)
- `SAVE` to save data in a file (e.g: `SAVE *"Program.bas"`)
- `ERASE` to delete a file

In addition, esxdos also has an NMI manager, an application that loads when NMI (`F5`) is pressed, and lets you browse the microSD card and load easily files (TAP, Z80, TRD, etc.). Pressing the "H" key invokes a help screen, which shows all the available keys.

[NOTE]
====
The esxdos manager shows file and directory entries in the order stored in the internal FAT table, and not alphabetically. If you want to see them ordered, you have to reorder the microSD card structure with a utility like Fat Sorter for Windows, https://fatsort.sourceforge.io/[FATsort] for Linux and MacOS, https://www.luisrios.eti.br/public/en_us/projects/yafs/[YAFS], http://www.trustfm.net/software/utilities/SDSorter.phpp[SDSorter] or other.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Ãf the card is also being used with a PC XT core, **do not use any FAT reordering utility** as it may stop DOS from booting.
====

<<<

==== ZXTRES Commands

As explained in the installation part, there are a series of commands that are exclusive to ZXTRES:

- `back16m`: Dumps to a `FLASH.ZX1` file, in the root directory of the microSD card, the contents of a 16 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM. After finishing, it is necessary to execute the command `.ls` so that the cache is written to the card
- `backzx2` or `backzxd`: Creates a `FLASH_32.ZX2` o `FLASH_32.ZXD` file, in the root directory of the microSD card, with the contents of a 32 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM.After finishing its execution, you must execute the command `.ls` to finish recording the cache on the microSD card. If not, the length of the file will be wrongly set to 0
- `corebios`: To upddate simultaneously ZX Spectrum core and BIOS
- `dmaplayw`: Plays .WAV file, which has to be 8 bits, unsigned and sampled at 15625 Hz
- `esprst`: Resets the WiFi ESP8266(ESP-12) module
- `iwconfig`: To configure the WiFi module
- `joyconf`: Configuration and tests for keyboard and DB joysticks
- `keymap`: Used to load a different keyboard map definition
- `loadpzx`: To load a .PZX tape file
- `loadtap`: To load a .TAP file, using the .PZX integration
- `playmid`: Plays .MID music files using the MIDI addon
- `playrmov`: Plays <<#_making_rdm_radastan_movie_files,radastanian format video files `.RDM`)>>. This command does not work on 48K mode.
- `romsback`: Dumps to a RomPack File named `ROMS.ZX1`, in the root directory of the microSD card, all ZX Spectrum core ROMS which are stored in SPI flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM. Only works correctly on ZX-Uno and ZXDOS (do not use on ZXTRES, ZXDOS+ or similar devices).
- `romsupgr`: Load from a RomPack filel named `ROMS.ZX1`, in the root directory of the microSD card, all ZX Spectrum core ROMS into SPI flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM
- `upgr16m`: Load the content of a `FLASH.ZX1` file, in the root directory of the microSD card, to a 16 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM
- `upgrzx2` or `upgrzxd`: Write the content of a `FLASH_32.ZX2` or `FLASH_32.ZXD` file, in the root directory of the microSD card, to a 32 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM.
- `zxuc`: Utility to configure al options of BIOS, which also can be stored in the microSD in configuration files that can be loaded later
- `zxunocfg`: Configuration utillity for certain features of ZX-Uno such as timings, contention, keyboard type, CPU speed, video type or vertical frequency

<<<

=== Making RDM (RaDastan Movie) files

The `PLAYRMOV` "DOT" command plays radastanian format video files. To convert your own videos, you need `makevideoradas`, a utility that is available at https://svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/software/modo_radastan/videos_radastanianos/[SVN repository].

If using Windows, there is already an executable file (`makevideoras.exe`). For Linux or MacOS, you must have installed command line developer utilities in order to compile an executable

[source,shell]
----
gcc makevideoradas.c -o makevideoradas
----

Apart from `makevdideoradas`, you need another two tools: https://ffmpeg.org[`ffmpeg`] and https://imagemagick.org/index.php[`imagemagick`]. These can be installed with a package manager (`apt`, `yum`, `pacmam`, `brew`, etc.) or downloading the source code and compiling.

Now, the first step to convert our video (for example `myvideo.mp4`), is exporting the frames as 128x96 pixel BMP image files. We create a temporary file (`img` for this example), to store them.

[source,shell]
----
mkdir img
(...)/ffmpeg -i myvideo.mp4 -vf "scale=128:96,fps=25" -start_number 0 img/output%05d.bmp
----

Now we transform the `BMP` files to 16 colours (v3) `BMP` files.

[source,shell]
----
(...)/magick mogrify -colors 16 -format bmp -define bmp:format=bmp3 img/*.bmp
----

Finally, we assemble the `.RDM` file (in this example `myvideo.rdm`) and cleanup the temporary files and directory.

[source,shell]
----
(...)/makevideoradas img/output
mv img/output.rdm ../myvideo.rdm
rm -rf img
----

There is more information about all this process at https://www.zonadepruebas.com/viewtopic.php?t=4796&start=110[this thread in Zona de Pruebas forums].

== Upgrade

=== BIOS

To update the BIOS, a file named `FIRMWARE.ZX2` (for a ZXTRES with an FPGA LX16 board) or `FIRMWARE.ZXD` (for a ZXTRES with an FPGA LX25 board) must be obtained. The latest version of the firmware files can be downloaded from https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/firmware[the official repository]

[CAUTION]
====
Updating the firmware (BIOS) is delicate. It should not be done if it is not necessary. If doing so, ensure that the ZXTRES has uninterrupted power (such as a UPS or a laptop USB with battery).
====

Copy the file to the root of the MicroSD card, turn on and press `F2` to enter BIOS, select `Upgrade`, choose __"Upgrade BIOS for ZX"__, and then __"SDfile"__. The system will read the file `FIRMWARE...` and notify when finished.

=== ROMs

The flash memory of a ZXTRES has reserved 64 slots, 16K each, to store ZX Spectrum ROM images. Thus, an original ZX Spectrum ROM (16K) will take one slot, a ZX Spectrum 128K ROM (32K) will be two slots, and a ZX Spectrum +2A ROM (64K) will need 4 slots.

You can add a new ROM pressing the key `N` at the BIOS <<#_roms,ROMs screen>>, connecting an audio cable to the board, and playing a ROM audio tape. ROM audio tapes can be made from a `.tap` file built with the `GenRom` utility, available at https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/modflash[ZX-Uno Code Repository].

To update at once all the ROMs installed for ZX Spectrum, a RomPack file named `ROMS.ZX1` must be obtained, which must be copied to the MicroSD card. Boot the ZXTRES using a "rooted" ROM, and then just enter the command `.romsupgr`. This will burn all the ROMs, which will be available for use.

[WARNING]
====
At this moment, `romsupgr`, only works correctly with RomPack files using a maximum of 35 slots.
====

[NOTE]
====
Remember that if the ZXTRES is started by pressing the `/` key (on the numeric keyboard), then the default ROM of the ZX Spectrum core will be loaded in" root "mode.
====

To do the opposite process (save the ROMs in a RomPack file named `ROMS.ZX1`), you can use the` .romsback` command.

[NOTE]
====
At this moment, `romsback`, only stores correctly the first 35 used slots.
====

RomPack files can be easily edited with the http: // guest: zxuno@svn.zxuno.comsvn/zxuno/software/ZX1RomPack/[ZX1RomPack] utility. Although it is a Windows program, it works perfectly, for example using https://www.winehq.org[Wine] or similar programs, either on MacOS or Linux.

=== Cores

A core is a file with the information needed for the FPGA to behave like a system to implement (ZX Spectrum, etc.). In ZXTRES, this file can be loaded possible from several different places: the SPI Flash memory, a microSD card, or from an external device (PC, etc.) using a special cable.

==== microSD card

===== Loading from the ZX Spectrum core

From the main ZX Spectrum core it is possible to load other cores. 

====== Bob Fossil Browser

In order to use the Bob Fossil browser to load cores, you need the following:

- The latest stable version (http://www.thefossilrecord.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/zx/BROWSE_latest.zip)
- The ZX3 plugin which can load Cores in ZX3 format https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/blob/master/SD/BIN/BPLUGINS/ZX3

Copy the corresponding `.ZX3` file to the desired location of the microSD card, as well as the appropriate ZX3 plugin (in the folder `BIN\BPLUGINS`).

. Start the ZXTRES Spectrum Core in root mode (by pressing `/` during BIOS boot until the border turns red).
. Press `F5` to open Bob Fossil's browser and get to the location of the Core with extension `.ZX3`, select it and press ENTER.

If all goes well, the bottom of the screen will indicate the flashing progress (it is recorded in a temporary slot of the flash memory).

In case you didn't boot in root mode, just reboot (ctrl+alt+backspace) while pressing "/" and try again.

<<<

==== SPI Flash Memory

There 27 spaces where you can store cores, with the first spaces being reserved for the main ZX Spectrum (this does not prevent having more ZX Spectrum cores in other spaces as well of the first ones).

Official cores are https://github.com/zxtres/cores[available to download] from GitHub repository.

To update or install a new core in the SPI Flash there are several possibilities.

The first options is to obtain the latest version of the files that define the core. If the space used is greater than 1179648 bytes, it has to be split accordingly into several files. Each of this pieces will be a file that must be named `COREXXy.ZX3`, where `XX` is _always_ a two digit number. The `y` part of the name is ignored, so you can use longer and more descriptive names (for example `CORE04_example_part1.ZX3`).

Copy the files to the root of the microSD card, turn on and press `F2` to enter BIOS. Choose `Upgrade`, select the row corresponding to the chosen core space (for example, 4), press enter and then __" SD file "__. The system will read the file `COREnn ..` and notify when it is updated, although first it will ask for the name (to be shown in the list to choose from at startup and in the BIOS list). Usually, for cores using more than one space, the name of the core is only used for the first space and the remaining spaces are registered with some text warning not to use them. Once it is installed, you can use the core on boot, choosing always the first space used by the core.

[WARNING]
====
The main ZX Spectrum core update is exactly the same as other cores, but, for the firsta part instead of the name `CORE1.ZXX` it has to be a file named `SPECTRUM.ZX3` and with a special format.

=== esxdos

To update esxdos to a new version, the distribution must be obtained from https://www.esxdos.org[the official website].

Once downloaded and extracted, the contents of `BIN` and `SYS` directories have to be copied to the root of the card, merging the existing ones (to preserve the exclusive ZXTRES commands).

Copy `ESXMMC.BIN` (or `ESXMMC.ROM`, depending on version) to the root of the microSD card.

Start ZXDOS + with the card inserted and press `F2` to access BIOS setup. Select the `Upgrade` menu and choose __"Upgrade esxdos for ZX"__. In the dialog that appears choose __"SD file"__ and, when it asks __"Load from SD"__ answer __"Yes"__ to the question __"Are you sure?"__. The content of the file `ESXDOS...` will be read, written to the flash storage and you will be notified when it is updated.

Do a Hard-reset, or turn it off and on.

If everything has been done correctly, when you turn on the ZXTRES you will see how esxdos detects the card and loads the necessary components to work, showing the new version at the top.

=== Flash Memory

You also can update all the FPGA flash memory. At this moment, from the BIOS you can only use 16MiB image files. To use a 32MiB image, you must use <<#_esxdos,esxdos>> `UPGRZXD` command and a file named `FLASH.ZXD`.

Copy the image file (16MiB) `FLASH.ZX3` to the root of the microSD card.

Turn on the ZXTRES and press the `F2` key during boot to access the BIOS setup. Select the menu `Upgrade` and then choos the option __"Upgrade flash from SD"__. Press Enter, choose `Yes`, and press Enter again to start the Flash writing process.

Do a Hard-Reset or turn of and on again.

[WARNING]
====
This process can't be undone, and it will replace all the previously installed cores, the BIOS, the ZX Spectrum ROMs and their configuration with the data in the image file.

== Other cores

=== ColecoVision

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColecoVision[ColecoVision] is Coleco Industries' home video-game console that was released in August 1982.

ZXTRES core is based on https://github.com/fbelavenuto/colecofpga[ZX-Uno version] by Fabio Belavenuto.

Some features of this core are:

- BIOS ROM is loaded from microSD card
- Supports multicart ROM, also loaded from microSD
- Only works with VGA

==== microSD card format

You need a microSD card with the first partition in FAT16 or FAT32 format to store ROM image files of the games to load and other needed files. These can be downloaded from https://github.com/fbelavenuto/colecofpga/tree/master/SD_Card[the original project in GitHub].

After copying these files to the card, you have to add also the file `MULTCART.ROM` which can be downloaded from https://t.me/zxtresfpga

See the <<#_cores,corresponding section>> for instructions of how to install the ColecoVision core in ZXTRES.

==== Keyboard

===== Special keys and buttons

While the core is running:

- Cursor or `Q`, `A`, `E`, `R` or joystick 1: Directional controls for player 1
- `Z` or joystick 1 main fire button: Fire Button 1 for player 1
- `U`, `J`, `O`, `P` or joystick 2: Directional controls for player 2
- `M` or joystick 2 main fire button: Fire button 1 for player 2
- `X` or joystick 1 secondary fire button: Fire button 1 for player 1 and player 2
- `0` to `9`: Button 0 to 9 for player 1 and player 2
- `T`: Button '*'
- `Y`: Button '#'
- 'Esc': Soft Reset

<<<

==== Basic Guide

On startup, BIOS ROM is loaded from the card, and then the multicart ROM.

[.text-center]
image:img/coleco.jpg[scaledwidth=70%]

At multicart menu, use the directional controls to choose one ROM, and then fire button 1 to load. Pressing 'Esc' restarts the core and loads the ROM selection menu again.

=== Test DP

Alternative Core, whose objective is to test the VGA, RGB and DisplayPort video outputs, applying different effects.

Its main features are:

- DisplaPort video output
- VGA video output
- 15 kHz RGB video output (using the VGA port)
- Scanlines
- Monochrome green, amber, white and colour modes

==== microSD Card Format

This core does not use the microSD card.

==== Keyboard

===== Special keys and buttons

While the core is running:

- `1`: Changes the VGA output to RGB 15 kHz.
- `2`: Turns scanlines on and off
- `3`: Toggles the display between colour, monochrome green, amber and white modes.

[NOTE]
====
The above mentioned effects with keys 2 and 3 are not visible on the original 15 kHz output.
====

==== Basic guide

When the core starts up, it sends the video signal via both VGA and DisplayPort. The refresh rate is about 64 Hz.

The three LEDs on the board have the following meaning:

- The one closest to the edge should be on all the time. This is the DONE LED, and it is managed by the FPGA itself, not the core.
- The middle one indicates, when lit, that there is a valid transmission link between the FPGA and the DisplayPort monitor. This means that the link is good, that the training has been successful, and that it is currently sending a video image to the monitor. If it is off, it means that the link could not be established (e.g. because the cable has been removed, or the monitor is turned off, or perhaps because the DisplayPort input is not selected on that monitor).
- The one on the other end should be blinking, at a rate of about one blink per second. This is a "heartbeat" of the pixel clock, indicating that both the VGA and DisplayPort outputs are generating an image. If this LED does not blink, no image of any kind can be seen on either VGA or DisplayPort, only RGB at 15 kHz. Under normal circumstances, whether a DisplayPort monitor is plugged in or not, this LED should be blinking.

== Other Hardware

=== Loading from tape

Some cores can load, as the original machines could, from a external audio device like a cassette player or something else simulating it.

Besides the card, you have to plug an appropriate audio cable to <<#_ports_and_connectors,ZXTRES audio input>>. It must have a 3.5 mm stero jack on one side, and two mono outputs on the other side (one for each audio channel). The right audio mono is connected to the audio player (this is not necessary with a miniduino, since it already uses only the right audio channel when playing).

==== Cassette Player

The use is exactly the same as when using the original computers:

. Plug the audio cable
. Type on the computer or select the tape loading option. For examle, for ZX Spectrum 48K, typing `J`, then, twice, `"` and then `Enter` to do the classic `LOAD "" + Enter`
. Start playing the tape (you may have to try several times adjusting the player volume)

==== Computer

Depending on the operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux) there are several programs that can either play a tape file (`TAP`, `TZX`, `PZX`, etc.) and output the sound through a headphone output, or create an audio file (`WAV`, `VOC`, `AU`, etc.) that can be played using a music or audio program.

===== PlayTZX

This program for Windows, MacOS or Linux, can play directly a `TZX` tape file through the audio output of the computer.

You can download the binary file (for example), for Windows from https://worldofspectrum.net/utilities/#tzxtools[World of Spectrum Classic] and for Mac from https://github.com/kounch/playtzx/releases[this GitHub repository]) or compile the source code as <<#_compile_source_code_macos_or_linux,explained later>>.

. Plug the audio cable between the computer audio output and ZXTRES audio input (remember to use only the right mono channel to the PC, Mac, etc. output)
. Type on the computer or select the tape loading option. For examle, for ZX Spectrum 48K, typing `J`, then, twice, `"` and then `Enter` to do the classic `LOAD "" + Enter`
. Start playing a tape file with this command (you may have to try several times adjusting the player volume)

[source,shell]
----
./playtzx <tape file path>
----

If everything works fine, you will see at the shell the name of the different tape data blocks, while the sound is played and the ZXTRES core loads the program.

[TIP]
====
On Linux, the program uses as output the device `/dev/dsp`, this may require to load a module like `snd_pcm_oss` (on systems using ALSA).
====

====== Compile source code (MacOS or Linux)

To compile, the first thing is checking that the developer tools are installed on the system, including a C compiler (`gcc`, `clang`, command line developer tools for Mac, etc.) and https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system[GNU Autotools].

Download the source code https://github.com/kounch/playtzx[from this repository]), extract the contents if needed and access from a terminal to the directory and type the commands:

[source,shell]
----
aclocal && autoconf && autoheader && automake --add-missing
./configure
make
----

If all goes well, a new file named `playtzx` has been created, which you can copy anywhere and then use. You can delete the compilation directory.

==== Mobile phone, tablet, MP3 player, etc.

There are a very few apps (or none) that can directly play a tape file on a mobile device so, in many cases, the only option is to convert it to an audio file before playing it.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baltazarstudios.playzxtapes[PlayZX] is an App for Android which can play tape files through the headphone output.

[WARNING]
====
The latest devices with headphone output are normally designed to work with impedances of only a few ohmis. This may, sometimes, not be enouth for the ZXTRES audio input.

In these cases, it's recommended (if possible) to disable headphone volume limitations and/or use a headphone amplifier that can give a higher impedance.
====

===== Audio file conversion

These are some of the many programas that exist and which can export tape files to audio files.

https://www.alessandrogrussu.it/tapir/index.html[Tapir] is a GUI program for Windows (but which can also run with Wine on Linux or Mac) that can load `TZX` and `TAP` files and export to `WAV` audio

`tape2wav` from https://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/[Fuse Utilities] is a command line utility that can export from `TZX` `PZX` and `TAP` to `WAV`.

`pzx2wav` in http://zxds.raxoft.cz/pzx.html[PZX Tools] is another command line utility which exports to `WAV`.

== Troubleshooting

=== Firmware images management

There are several tools with you can use to make and/or edit the contents of `ZX1`, `ZX3` files.

==== zx123_tool

This is a tool to analyze, extract and inject data in SPI flash image files for ZX-Uno, ZXDOS and similar devices.

You need to have https://www.python.org/[Python 3] to use it. Depending on the operating system you may have to https://www.python.org/downloads/[install it].

Having Python 3, you only need to download the latest version of the tool from the official repository, following https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/releases/latest[this link].

Once extracted, you have to run from a shell the main script using Python 3. This may change depending on the operating system.

For example, on Windows, it's usually:

[source,shell]
----
py -3 zx123_tool.py
----

With other operating systems it normally is like:

[source,shell]
----
python3 ./zx123_tool.py
----

You also need a SPI flash image file. This can be obtained from within the Spectrum core in "root" mode, with one of the commands `back16m`, `backzx2` or `backzxd`. Once you have obtained the exteacted file from the microSD, you can "clean" it leaving only the Spectrum core and the first Spectrum ROM with a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -w -o FLASHempty.ZXD
----

Where `FLASH.ZXD` is the path to the original file and `FLASHempty.ZXD` is the path to the new "clean" file.

<<<

*List the contents of an image*

To see the contents of an image file named `FLASH.ZXD` (installed cores and some configuration info), you can use the command

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -l
----

To show the contents of the same file, including ZX Spectrun ROMs info:

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -l -r
----

*Change the BIOS of an image*

To change the BIOS inside a file named `FLASH.ZXD`, using the BIOS file named `FIRMWARE.ZXD`

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a BIOS,FIRMWARE.ZXD
----

You can, at the same time, modify some of the default parameters. For example, with the options; `-m` for video mode: 0 (PAL), 1 (NTSC) or 2 (VGA), `-k` for the keyboard layout: 0 (Auto), 1 (ES), 2 (EN) or 3 (Spectrum).

This way to change the BIOS of a file named `FLASH.ZXD`, using the BIOS file `FIRMWARE.ZXD`, and also set the video mode to VGA:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a BIOS,FIRMWARE.ZXD -m 2 -k 3
----

There are also options to set the BIOS boot delay time, the default core or the default Spectrum ROM. See the https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/[documentation] for more info.

<<<

*Add a Spectrum ROM to an image*

To add a Spectrum ROM file named `48.rom`, with the name `Spec48` and using the slot number 5, you can use a command like:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a ROM,5,xdnlh17,Spec48,48.rom
----

See the https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/[documentation] for all the possible options when adding a Spectrum ROM.

Amongst the information you give when adding a ROM, there are some flags used to tell which hardware options, etc, you want to have enabled or disabled when loading the ROM, as shown in this table:

[align="center",width="70%",%header,cols=2*]
|===
|`i`
|Keyboard issue 3 enabled (instead of issue 2)
|`c`
|Disable memory contention
|`d`
|Enable DivMMC
|`n`
|Enable NMI DivMMC (esxdos Menu)
|`p`
|Use Pentagon Timings
|`t`
|Use 128K timings
|`s`
|Disable DivMMC and ZXMMC ports
|`m`
|Enable Timex Horizontal MMU
|`h`
|Disable ROM high bit (1FFD bit 2)
|`l`
|Disable ROM low bit (7FFD bit 4)
|`1`
|Disable 1FFD port (+2A/3 paging)
|`7`
|Disable 7FFD port (128K paging)
|`2`
|Disable TurboSound (secondary AY chip)
|`a`
|Disable AY chip
|`r`
|Disable Radastanian mode
|`x`
|Disable Timex mode
|`u`
|Disable ULAPlus
|===

<<<

*Install a Core to an image*

For example, to install a core in space 3, from a file named `NEXT.ZXD`, with the name `Spectrum Next`, use a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a 'CORE,3,Spectrum Next,NEXT.ZXD'
----

If you want also to set the core as the default, use a command like:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a 'CORE,3,Spectrum Next,NEXT.ZXD' -c 3
----

*Change esxdos ROM of an image*

Just like the BIOS firmware, you can install a ROM esxdos file, with a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -a esxdos,ESXMMC.BIN
----

*Mix several actions in one line*

Please do note that you can add several actions in one command line. For example, to "clean" an image file named `FLASH.ZXD`, creating a new one named `FLASHnew.ZXD`, installing the BIOS from the file `FIRMWARE.ZXD`, set up video mode to VGA, the keyboard in Spectrum mode, add a Spectrum ROM file `48.rom`, with the name `Spec48` while ussing slot number 5, install a core at space 3, from a file named `NEXT.ZXD`, with the name `Spectrum Next`, as default core:

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZXD -w -o FLASHnew.ZXD -a BIOS,FIRMWARE.ZXD -m 2 -k 3 -a ROM,5,xdnlh17,Spec48,48.rom -a CORE,3,SpecNext,NEXT.ZXD -c 3
----

<<<

=== Firmware recovery

Sometimes (e.g. when installing an experimental core or when upgrading the ZX Spectrum Core or the BIOS) it may happen that the ZXTRES stops booting. The board LEDs are on, but there is no display, and it doesn't do anything when trying the different key combinations to access BIOS setup, etc.

When this happens, there are several recovery methods that let you install again the firmware.

==== JTAG cable connections

Later, in some of the recovery steps, when talking about jump wires or USB-Blaster connections to the ZXTRES board, you can use these images as reference.

[.text-center]
image:img/jtagzxtres.jpg[scaledwidth=80%]

[WARNING]
====
*DO NOT* connect the 3V line
====

<<<

==== Recovery using a Raspberry Pi

*Hardware required*:

- Raspberry Pi (with SD card, keyboard, display, power supply, etc.) and with internet connection
- 5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_wire[jump wires] (if possible, female on both sides) or, instead a USB-Blaster cable
- One screwdriver for ZXTRES cover screws
- SD for ZXTRES with the first partition formatted as FAT16 or FAT32
- Keyboard and display for ZXTRES

*Software required*:

- Flash image and recovery file for ZXTRES from https://github.com/zxtres/cores/tree/main/recovery[the main Github repository]. Please take note that there is a different file for each device:
** `recovery_a35.bit` for ZXTRES
** `recovery_a100.bit` for ZXTRES+
** `recovery_a200.bit` for ZXTRES++

*Instruction Steps*:

. Install Raspberry Pi OS (formerly known as Raspbian) to the Raspberry Pi SD card (using https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/[the official download], https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/[NOOBS], https://github.com/procount/pinn[PINN], etc.)
. Install Open OCD:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git autoconf libtool make pkg-config
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev telnet
sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libftdi-dev
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd-code
cd openocd-code/
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-usb_blaster --enable-sysfsgpio --enable-bcm2835gpio
make
sudo make install
cd ..
rm -rf ./openocd-code
----

<<<

[start=3]
. Connect USB-Blaster or jump wires if using GPIO. In this case, open the ZXTRES case and, <<#_jtag_cable_connections,as explained before>> connect the FPGA JTAG lines (`TMS`, `TDI`, `TDO`, `TCK` and `GND`), using the wires, to the Raspberry Pi https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPIO[GPIO] pins.

Is using a GPIO connection, take note of the chosen pins, making sure that `GND` is connected with `GND`.

[.text-center]
image:img/gpio.jpg[scaledwidth=70%]

In this example, the `31`, `33`, `35`, `37` and `39` pins will be used (corresponding to `GPIO #6`, `GPIO #13`, `GPIO #19`, `GPIO #26` and `GND`), like this:

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|ZXTRES JTAG
|GPIO
|Raspberry Pi Pin
|`TMS`
|GPIO#6
|`31`
|`TDI`
|GPIO#13

|`TDO`
|GPIO#19
|`35`
|`TCK`
|GPIO#26
|`37`
|`GND`
|GND
|`39`
|===

[start=4]
. Copy to the Raspberry Pi the file named `recovery_axx.bit` previously downloaded from https://github.com/zxtres/cores/tree/main/recovery[the main Github repository]. For our example, it will be at `/home/pi/zxtres/unbrick/`

. If using GPIO, make a copy of Open OCD configuration file, to the same directory where `recovery.bit` is.

[source,shell]
----
cp /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/raspberrypi2-native.cfg /home/pi/zxtres/unbrick/
----

<<<

[start=6]
. For GPIO connection, edit `raspberrypi2-native.cfg` copy, updating `bcm2835gpio_jtag_nums` (uncommenting, if necessary), with your JTAG and GPIO connection numbers, at the line `bcm2835gpio_jtag_nums`. For our example:

[source]
----
# Header pin numbers: 37 31 33 35
bcm2835gpio_jtag_nums 26 6 13 19
----

[start=7]
. Comment, if it wasn't already, the line `bcm2835gpio_swd_nums` (not necessary for USB-Blaster connection):

[source]
----
#bcm2835gpio_swd_nums 11 25
----

[start=8]
. Add, to the end of the file, the line `adapter speed 250` (again, not necessary for USB-Blaster):

[source]
----
adapter speed 250
----

[start=9]
. Turn on the ZXTRES.

. Make sure that, on the Raspberry Pi, we are in the directory where `recovery_axx.bit` is, and execute the command that loads the BIOS on recovery mode, using the path to the previously edited `raspberrypi2-native.cfg`.

For GPIO connection:

[source,shell]
----
cd /home/pi/zxtres/unbrick
sudo openocd -f /home/pi/zxtres/unbrick/raspberrypi2-native.cfg -f /home/pi/zxtres/unbrick/xilinx-xc7.cfg -c "init; pld load 0 recovery_axx.bit; shutdown"
----

For USB-Blaster connection:

[source,shell]
----
cd /home/pi/zxtres/unbrick
sudo openocd -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/altera-usb-blaster.cfg -f /home/pi/zxtres/unbrick/xilinx-xc7.cfg -c "init; pld load 0 recovery_axx.bit; shutdown"
----

[TIP]
====
Remember to type the right name replacing `recovery_axx.bit` in the previous commands.
====
<<<

[start=11]
. If all goes well, we will see that the FPGA LED change their state and the BIOS is shown on the display.

If there is no image on the display, and you are not using DisplaPort, press `Scroll Lock`to switch between RGB and VGA modes, just in case the recovery BIOS did start in the wrong mode for our setup.

[.text-center]
image:img/recovery.png[scaledwidth=70%]

[start=12]
. Insert in the ZXTRES the SD card formatted as FAT16 o FAT32, and with the `FLASH.ZX3` file downloaded previously.

. If using a USB-Blaster connection, unplug the connector.

<<<

[start=14]
. Select the option `Upgrade Flash from SD`. Press Enter, choose `Yes`, and press Enter again to start the Flash writing process.

[.text-center]
image:img/recovery2.png[scaledwidth=70%]

[WARNING]
====
This process can't be undone, and it will replace all the previously installed cores, the BIOS, the ZX Spectrum ROMs and their configuration with the data in the image file.
====

[start=15]
. After some minutes, the process will end, and, after turning the ZXTRES off and on, it should start fine.
