== Introduction

ZXUNO+ and +UNO are another iteration of https://zxuno.speccy.org[ZX-Uno] a hardware and software project based on an FPGA board programmed to work like a ZX Spectrum computer, and created by the ZX-Uno team: Superfo, AVillena, McLeod, Quest and Hark0.

Over time, the project has been growing, and now it is possible to install different configurations (cores) in the flash memory of the FPGA, which work like different systems than the ZX Spectrum, and you can choose to start the ZXUNO+ with the desired configuration among all those installed.

ZXUNO+ official web page is https://zxuno.speccy.org.

=== Initial Setup

In order to be able to set up and use a ZXUNO+ you need, at least, the following:

- A USB charger or a TV or other device that offers USB power. Usually 500 mA is more than enough
- VGA cable and monitor
- PS/2 keyboard (with USB to PS/2 adapter or connector)

In order to take advantage of its full potential, you may also have:

- A SD card, not necessarily very large
- PC speakers to connect to the audio output, or a stereo jack converter to two red/white RCA connectors to connect to the TV
- A PS/2 mouse (USB to PS/2 adapter needed)
- An audio cable with a stereo 3.5 mm jack on one side, and both audio channels split into two mono outputs on the other side, if you want to use an audio player and/or recorder, like, for example, a Miniduino (<<#_miniduino,see more info later>>)., a PC/Mac/Raspberry PI, etc. or a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_tape[cassette tape] recorder/player. The right sound channel is used as input (EAR) and the left channel can be used as output (MIC).

==== SD card formatting

In order to use a SD card, it has to be formatted with, at least, one FAT16 or FAT32 format (depending on the case, one or the other format is recommended for compatibility with different third-party cores). It must be the first partition if there are more than one, except for the Spectrum core which can have <<#_sd_advanced_format_3e,the first partition in +3DOS format, and then the second one in FAT16 or FAT32 format>> to use with a +3e ROM.

[NOTE]
====
FAT16 partitions have a maximum size of 4GB
====

[WARNING]
====
When naming a partition which will be used with esxdos, it's important not to use the same of any directory inside, or an access error will happen when trying to see the contents (e.g. do not name the partition as `BIN`, `SYS` or `TMP`).
====

[TIP]
====
The Spectrum core can also have <<#_sd_advanced_format_3e,the first partition in +3DOS format, and then the second one in FAT16 or FAT32 format>> to use with a +3e ROM.

===== Windows

For simple configurations, and cards of the right size (less than 2GB for FAT16 or less than 32GB for FAT32), you can use https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/[the official formatting tool of the SD Association ].

For other, more complex, configurations, and depending on operating system version, you may use the command line tool `diskpart` or Windows Disk Management GUI.

For example, on Windows, to format a card with just one FAT16 partition (if the card is 4GB or less in size), which is shown as disk 6 when typing `list disk` on `diskpart`:

[source]
----
select disk 6
clean
create part primary
active
format FS=FAT label=ZXUNOPLUS
exit
----

To create two 4GB FAT16 partitions (for example, to use with MSX core) and leave the rest of the space with a third one in FAT32 format (for cards of more than 8GB):

[source]
----
select disk 6
clean
create part primary size=4000
set id=06
active
format fs=FAT label=ZXUNOPLUS quick
create part primary size=4000
format fs=FAT label=EXTRA quick
create part primary
format fs=FAT32 label=DATA quick
exit
----

To create one 4GB FAT16 partition (for example, to use with Amstrad CPC 6128 core) and leave the rest of the space with another one in FAT32 format (for cards of more than 4GB):

[source]
----
select disk 6
clean
create part primary size=4000
set id=0b
active
format fs=FAT32 label=ZXUNOPLUS unit=4k quick
create part primary
format fs=FAT32 label=EXTRA quick
exit
----

<<<

===== macOS

For simple configurations, and cards of the right size (less than 2GB for FAT16 or less than 32GB for FAT32), you can use https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/[the official formatting tool of the SD Association ] or Disk Utility, which is included with the operating system.

In other case, you should use the command line.

For example, to format a card, shown as `disk6`, with only one FAT16 partition (if the card size is less than 2GB):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR "MS-DOS FAT16" ZXUNOPLUS R
----

To split it into two FAT16 partitions of the same size (if the card size is 4GB or less):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR "MS-DOS FAT16" ZXUNOPLUS 50% "MS-DOS FAT16" EXTRA 50%
----

To create two FAT 16 partitions (e.g. to use MSX core) and have the rest of space as another FAT32 partition (for cards more than 8GB in size):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR %DOS_FAT_16% ZXUNOPLUS 4G %DOS_FAT_16% EXTRA 4G "MS-DOS FAT32" DATA R
sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 -v ZXUNOPLUS -c 128 /dev/rdisk6s1
sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 -v EXTRA -b 4096 -c 128 /dev/rdisk6s2
----

[NOTE]
====
`diskutil` cannot create FAT16 partitions which are bigger than 2G and also format them. That's why, in this example, after only creating the partitions, we have to format them.
====

<<<

To create one FAT32 4GB partition (e.g. to use with Amstrad CPC 6128 core), and then have the rest of space available as a second FAT32 partition (for cards of more than 4GB):

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR "MS-DOS FAT32" ZXUNOPLUS 4G "MS-DOS FAT32" EXTRA R
----

[NOTE]
====
In this example, since the partition has a size of exactly 4G, macOS will use a cluster size of 4096, which is the one needed for the Amstrad CPC 6128 core. For a smaller size, you may have to format again the first partition with some commands like these:

[source,shell]
----
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk6
newfs_msdos -F 32 -v ZXUNOPLUS -b 4096 /dev/rdisk6s1
----
====

[TIP]
====
The Spotlight feature in macOS you to search the items on the SD card, creating a number of hidden files. You can disable the indexing with these commands (assuming that the SD partition is named `ZXUNOPLUS`):

[source,shell]
----
mdutil -i off /Volumes/ZXUNOPLUS
cd /Volumes/ZXUNOPLUS
rm -rf .{,_.}{fseventsd,Spotlight-V*,Trashes}
mkdir .fseventsd
touch .fseventsd/no_log .metadata_never_index .Trashes
cd -
----
====

<<<

===== Linux

There are a lot of tools for Linux that can format and/or partition an SD card (`fdisk`, `parted`, `cfdisk`, `sfdisk` or `GParted` to name a few). It should only be taken into account that the partition scheme must always be MBR, and the first partition (the one that will be used for esxdos) must be primary partition.

For example, to format a card, shown as `sdc`, with only one FAT16 partition (if the card size is less than 4GB)

[source,shell]
----
sudo fdisk --compatibility=dos /dev/sdc
----

[source]
----

=== Keyboard and mouse

==== +UNO keyboard

The +UNO keyboard, being similar to the original ZX Spectrum keyboard, lacks some of the existing keys on a modern PC keyboard. The keyboard membrane is connected to an Arduino board, which manages the transformation key presses to PS/2 keyboard protocol. The board is programmed so it can behave in different modes according to your needs.

The default is ZX Spectrum mode. To change to a different mode, you must press `Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+U` and then the key for the desired mode. After doing that, some text is automatically typed, to show the selected mode (for example `.zx` if you press `Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+U` and then `0`).

This table shows the available modes and activation keys:

==== PS/2 Keyboard

The keyboard map (physical keys of the keyboard assignment to the keystrokes that are presented to the different cores) is changed using the `Advanced` menu of the BIOS. There are three different maps to choose from: Spanish (default), English, and Spectrum (advanced).

You can also change it using the `keymap` utility. Inside `/sys` you have to create a directory named `keymaps` and copy inside the keyboard map files that you want to use. For example, to switch to the US map you have to write `.keymap us` from esxdos.

For the map to be preserved after a master reset, it has to be selected as `Default` in the BIOS.

For more information, see https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=208[this message in the ZX-Uno forum].

==== Special keys and buttons

Special keys which can be used during startup:

- `F2` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+2` on +UNO): Enter BIOS setup
- `Caps Lock` or `Cursor down` or, if a joystick is connected, pressing `down`: Core selection menu
- `Esc`, or if a joystick with two or more fire buttons is connected, pressing the 2nd fire button: ZX Spectrum core ROM selection menu
- `R`: Loads the Spectrum core ROM in "real" mode, disabling esxdos, new graphics modes, etc. (pressing `Esc` afterwards allows you to choose another core)
- `/` (numeric keyboard): Load the default ZX Spectrum core ROM in "root" mode (pressing `Esc` afterwards allows you to choose another core)
- Number from `1` to `9`: Load the core in the flash location corresponding to that number

Special keys that can be used while running the main core (ZX Spectrum):

- `Esc`: BREAK
- `F2` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+2` on +UNO): Edit
- `F3` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+3` on +UNO): True Video
- `F4` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+4` on +UNO): Inverse Video
- `F5` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+5` on +UNO): NMI
- `F7` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+7` on +UNO): Play or pause when playing .PZX files
- `F8` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+8` on +UNO): Rewind .PZX file to the previous mark
- `F10` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+0` on +UNO): Graph
- `F12` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+W` on +UNO): Turbo Boost. Speeds up CPU to 28MHz while pressed (beginning with core EXP27).
- `Ctrl+Alt+Backspace` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+B` on +UNO): Hard reset. Backspace is the delete key, located in the top-right portion of the keyboard, above `Enter`.
- `Ctrl+Alt+Del` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+N` on +UNO): Soft reset.
- `Scroll Lock`: Switches between composite and VGA video modes.

<<<

==== PS/2 Mouse

You can also connect a mouse to the PS/2 port. The switch inside a +UNO, near the Wi-Fi chip and keys `1` and `2`, selects between a direct connection of the mouse, or if a PS/2 splitter cable is needed (when using the mouse along with a PS/2 keyboard).

=== esxdos

https://esxdos.org/index.html[esxdos] is a firmware for the DivIDE/DivMMC hardware interfaces (which ZXUNO+ implements). This allows access to storage devices such as a SD card. It includes commands similar to those of UNIX, although to use them you must precede them with a period, for example `.ls`,` .cd`, `.mv`, etc.

For it to work, it is necessary to include the corresponding files in the first partition of the SD card.

At the time of writing this document, the version included with ZXUNO+ is 0.8.6, and it can be downloaded from the official website https://www.esxdos.org/files/esxdos086.zip[at this link].

Once downloaded and extracted, you have to copy the directories `BIN`, `SYS` and `TMP`, and all of their content, to the root of first partition of the SD card.

If everything has been done correctly, when you turn on the ZXUNO+ Spectrum core, you will see how esxdos detects the card and loads the necessary components to work.

[.text-center]

<<<

It is also recommended to add the specific esxdos commands for ZXUNO+. These can be obtained from the project source page (https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/SD[here], https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/[here] and https://guest:zxuno@svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/software/upgrade[here]), and are as follows:

    back16m
    corebios
    dmaplayw
    esprst
    iwconfig
    joyconf
    keymap
    loadpzx
    playmid
    playrmov
    romsback
    romsupgr
    upgr16m
    zxuc
    zxunocfg

<<#_zxuno_commands,It is explained later>> what each of them does.

=== BIOS

[.text-center]
image:./img/boot.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Pressing the `F2` key during boot will access the BIOS setup. The BIOS firmware is the first program that runs when the ZXUNO+ is turned on. The main purpose of BIOS is to start and test the hardware and load one of the installed cores.

Using left and right cursor keys, you can navigate through the BIOS setup screens. With up and down keys you can choose the different elements of each screen and, with the `Enter` key, it is possible to activate and choose the options for each of these. The `Esc` key is used to close open option windows without applying any action.

[TIP]
====
You can also access the BIOS if you have an adapter and a joystick connected, pressing the down direction button on startup. This accesses the list of installed cores. Choose the latest option (`Enter Setup`) to access.
====

Other useful keys to use on startup are:

- `Scroll Lock` or `Cursor Down`, or, if a joystick is connected, pressing the down direction button: Core Selection Menu
- `Esc` or, if a joystick with two or more buttons is connected, pressing the second fire: ZX Spectrum Core ROM selection menu
- `R`: Load the ZX Spectrum default ROM in "real" mode disabling esxdos, new graphic modes, etc. (combined with `Esc` let's you use a different ROM)
- `/` (numeric keypad): Load the ZX Spectrum default ROM in  in "root" mode (combined with `Esc` let's you use a different ROM)
- Number between `1` and `9`: Load the corresponding core from Flash

==== Main

[.text-center]
image:img/bios.png[scaledwidth=70%]

In the first configuration screen, in addition to being able to run several tests, you can define the default behavior for the following:

- Boot Timer: Sets how long the boot screen is available (or hiding it completely)
- Check CRC: Check ROM integrity when loading (more secure) or bypassing it (faster)
- Keyboard
- Timing: ULA Behaviour (48K, 128K, Pentagon Modes)
- Contended
- DivMMC
- DivMMC NMI Support
- New Graphic Modes Support (ULAPlus, Timex, Radastan)

More technical information can be found on https://www.zxuno.com/wiki/index.php/ZX_Spectrum[the ZX-Uno Wiki].

<<<

==== ROMs

[.text-center]
image:img/bios2.png[scaledwidth=70%]

The second screen shows the installed ZX Spectrum ROMs. You can reorder (Move Up, Move Down), rename or delete each of them, as well as choose the one that will be loaded by default at startup (Set Active ).

==== Upgrade

[.text-center]
image:img/bios3.png[scaledwidth=70%]

_Upgrade_ screen is used to perform the different updates of the Flash memory content: esxdos, BIOS, Cores, etc. (see <<#_upgrade,the section corresponding to upgrades>> for more information).

<<<

==== Boot

[.text-center]
image:img/bios4.png[scaledwidth=70%]

In the _Boot_ screen you can choose which one of the installed cores is loaded by default at startup.

[CAUTION]
====
Never set a Spectrum core (apart from the main one, the first core in the flash. This would set the ZX-Uno into a loop of core resets.
====

<<<

==== Advanced

[.text-center]
image:img/bios5.png[scaledwidth=70%]

The Advanced configuration screen is used to edit the following settings:

- Keyboard layout (Keyb Layout): See <<#_keyboard,the corresponding section>> for more information)
- Joystick behavior when emulated with the numeric keypad (Joy Keypad) and the second joystick (with splitter): Kempston, Sinclair Joystick 1, Sinclair Joystick 2, Protek or Fuller
- Behavior of a joystick connected to the main port (Joy DB9): Kempston, Sinclair Joystick 1, Sinclair Joystick 2, Protek, Fuller or simulate the keys `Q`,` A`, `O`,` P`, `Space` and `M`
- Enable the second physical joystick (splitter). Only on +UNO and for cores which have splitter support 
- Video output: PAL, NTSC or VGA
- Scanlines simulation: Enabled or Disabled
- VGA horizontal frequency: 50, 51, etc.
- CPU speed: Normal (1x) or accelerated (2X, 3X, etc.)
- Csync: Spectrum or PAL

This table explains how the joystick buttons are assigned:

- Save changes without exiting
- Discard Changes

== ZX Spectrum

The main core is the one implementing a ZX Spectrum computer. This core is special, and it cannot be replaced for another that is not a ZX Spectrum, since the ZXUNO+ uses it for its operation.

These are some of its main characteristics:

- ZX Spectrum 48K, 128K, Pentagon and Chloe 280SE implementation
- ULA with ULAplus, Timex and Radastan modes (including hardware scroll and selectable palette group)
- Ability to disable memory contention (for Pentagon 128 compatibility)
- Ability to choose the keyboard behavior (issue 2 or issue 3)
- Possibility to choose the timing of the ULA (48K, 128K or Pentagon)
- Control of screen framing, configurable for type of timing, and possibility to choose between original Spectrum synchronism or progressive PAL standard.
- Timex horizontal MMU support with HOME, DOC and EXT banks in RAM.
- Programmable raster interruption in line number, for any TV line.
- Possibility of activating/deactivating memory bank management registers, for better compatibility with each implemented model
- Ability to activate / deactivate the devices incorporated into the core to improve compatibility with certain programs
- ZXMMC and DIVMMC support for + 3e, esxdos and compatible firmwares
- Turbo Sound support
- SpecDrum support
- Covox support
- Each channel A, B, C of the two AY-3-8912, beeper and SpecDrum chips can be directed to the left, right, both or neither outputs, allowing the implementation of configurations such as ACB, ABC, etc.
- Real joystick and keyboard joystick support with Kempston, Sinclair 1 and 2, Cursor, Fuller and QAOPSpcM protocol.
- Turbo mode support at 7MHz, 14MHz, 28MHz
- Keyboard support (PS/2 protocol) and user-configurable mapping from within Spectrum itself.
- PS/2 mouse support emulating the Kempston Mouse protocol.
- Possibility of video output in composite video mode, RGB 15kHz  (PAL and NTSC), or VGA.
- User selectable vertical refresh rate to improve compatibility with VGA monitors.
- Multicore boot support: from the Spectrum you can select an address of the SPI Flash and the FPGA will load a core from there.
- Loading `PZX` tape files from SD

<<<

=== ROMs

The ZX Spectrum core can be initialized using different ROM versions (48K, 128K, Plus 2, etc.). These are stored in the flash memory of the ZXUNO+, and you can choose which one to load by pressing the `Esc` key during boot. You can also define the ROM that you want to load by default using the BIOS setup.

See the <<#_roms_3,updates section>> for more information on how to expand or modify the ROMs stored in flash memory.

==== DerbyPro

https://www.facebook.com/groups/DerbyPro[DerbyPro or Derby{pp}] is an enhanced firmware ROM for the ZX Spectrum based on v1.4 of the Derby development ROM. The Spectrum 128 (codename "Derby") was a Spanish machine commissioned by Investronica and launched in 1985. It came with a keypad that provided additional editing keys. In 1986 the UK version came out with a simplified version of 128 BASIC and no keypad. Derby++ is developed from the Spanish ROM to include the benefits of both versions without the drawbacks and support for new hardware developments.

[.text-center]
image:img/derbypro.png[pdfwidth=70%]

<<<

Features include:

- 100% binary compatible 48K mode.
- 6-channel PLAY commmand.
- Access the esxDOS NMI browser from the boot menu.
- Debugged 128 BASIC with additinoal commands and full scren string editor.
- esxDOS support in 128 BASIC.
- Menu access to TR-DOS.
- PALETTE command for ULAplus.
- Run most Spectrum software without the need to switch configuration in the BIOS.

You can download the ROM, a user manual and other files from the https://www.facebook.com/groups/DerbyPro[official Facebook Public Group].

Because it's a 64K ROM with support for new hardware these flags can be used when <<#_zx123_tool,adding it to the SPI flash>>:

|===
|Flag
|Meaning
|`d`
|Enable divMMC
|`n`
|Enable NMI divMMC (esxDOS Menu)
|`t`

==== CargandoLeches

CargandoLeches is a set of ZX Spectrum ROMs that started as a project to load games in any Spectrum model 15-20x faster. No tape is needed, but a digital audio source, as a computer, mobile device, MP3 player, etc. The new ROM detects the loading method and reverts to the original ROM code if needed. This is handled transparently, with no user or program intervention.

Since version 2.0 the project changed from a single ROM to more, each one with different options. This way, you can choose a different mix of options that may include:

- Ultrafast loading
- Reset & Play (After a software reset of the core, the system is ready to load from tape)
- POKE editor
- Enable or disable Sinclair BASIC token expansion

The whole ROM set is available to download from the repository in GitHub https://github.com/antoniovillena/CargandoLeches/tree/master/binaries[here].

Depending on which ROM you choose, the flags when <<#_zx123_tool,adding to the SPI flash>> may vary. For example, for the ROM `48le_ea_re_po` (with all features enabled), these flags can be used (we cannot enable NMI DivMMC since the POKE editor will use it):

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Flag
|Meaning
|`d`
|Enable DivMMC
|`h`
|Disable ROM high bit (1FFD bit 2)
|`l`
|Disable ROM low bit (7FFD bit 4)
|`x`
|Disable Timex mode
|===

===== POKEs

When using a ROM with POKE option enabled:

. Once the game is loaded, after pressing NMI a field will appear in the upper left corner of the screen
. Enter the POKE address and press `Enter`
. Enter the POKE value and press `Enter` again
. Repeat steps 2. and 3. until all the desired POKEs are entered. To finish and return to the game, press `Enter` twice

<<<

===== Preparing ultrafast loading tapes

The ROMs with ultrafast loading enabled, need special tape audio data which is made from normal loading `TAP` files, without protections or turbo loading.

In order to create an ultrafast loading tape you need  `leches` and `CgLeches` command line utilities. Those can be obtained, for Windows, from the
https://github.com/antoniovillena/CargandoLeches/tree/master/binaries[official repository]. You can also obtain an unofficial version for macOS from  https://github.com/kounch/CargandoLeches/tree/master/binaries/MacOS[this other repository].

In any other case, you can compile from the https://github.com/antoniovillena/CargandoLeches[source code at the official repository]. For example, in Linux, to compile using `gcc` you only need these commands:

[source,shell]
----
gcc leches.c -o leches
gcc CgLeches.c -o CgLeches
----

To create an ultrafast loading tape you have to use the `CgLeches` command from a terminal, giving, at least, the path to the original `TAP` file and also to the new file to create (`WAV` or `TZX`). There are also some other optional parameters, like the loading speed, between 0 and 7 (where 0 is fastest but also more incompatible), if you want to create a mono or stereo file (when making a `WAV`), and more.

Thus, to make a `WAV` file with an ultrafast loading tape from the file `Valley.tap`, with loading speed 5, you could type:

[source,shell]
----
(...) CgLeches Valley.tap Valley.wav 5
----

This way, the file `Valley.wav` can be played from a computer or another device and load using the ROM (see the section about <<#_loading_from_tape,loading from tape>> for more info).

[WARNING]
====
Due to hardware limitations, `TZX` files made with `CgLeches` do not work with a <<#_miniduino,Miniduino>>, although they usually work with <<#_playtzx,`PlayTZX`>>.

==== SE Basic IV

https://source-solutions.github.io/sebasic4/[SE Basic IV] is a free open-source BASIC interpreter for the Z80 architecture. Although it aims for a high degree of compatibility with Microsoft BASIC, there are some differences. It's designed to run on the https://www.patreon.com/chloe280se[Chloe 280SE] but it's also compatible with the ZX Spectrum core of the ZXUNO+.

SE BASIC began development in 1999 as the firmware for the https://sinclair.wiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_SE[ZX Spectrum SE], the ancestor of the Chloe 280SE. Early versions were patches applied to the original Spectrum ROM. From version 1, it used its own assembly file. From version 2, it added support for ULAplus.

Version 3 (https://zxdesign.itch.io/opense[OpenSE BASIC]) replaced the original ROM code with an open source version derived from the https://github.com/cheveron/open81[ZX81] and https://github.com/cheveron/samrom[SAM CoupÃ©] ROMs. It's still maintained as an open source replacement firmware for the Spectrum, and is included in the main https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/opense-basic[Debian repository] for use with emulators.

[.text-center]
image:img/sebasic4.png[scaledwidth=70%]

Version 4.0 added support for 80 column mode. Version 4.1 was an unsuccessful attempt to refactor the code. Starting in 2019, the latest version (4.2 Cordelia) was rebuilt from the ground up to take full advantage of the ZX Spectrum core of the ZX-Uno (and ZXUNO+). While earlier versions retained a high level of compatibility with Sinclair BASIC and software, this version has no support for Sinclair software and is closer in dialect to Atari BASIC.

Version 4.2 requires that divMMC support is enabled with esxDOS or UnoDOS 3 installed. However, <<#_esxdos_commands,"dot" command >> commands and the NMI browser are not supported.

<<<

Features include:

- 40 column (16 colour) and 80 column (2 colour) paletted video modes.
- Always-on expression evaluation (use variables as filenames).
- Application package format with support for turning BASIC programs into apps.
- Automatic data typing.
- Bitwise logic (AND, NOT, OR, XOR).
- Built-in help system.
- Choice of Microsoft (LEFT$, MID$, RIGHT$) or Sinclair (TO) string slicing.
- Composable characters (supports Vietnamese).
- Disk-based filesystem (no tapes).
- Error handling (ON ERROR..., TRACE).
- Flow control (IF...THEN...ELSE, WHILE...WEND).
- Full random file access from BASIC (OPEN, CLOSE, SEEK).
- Full-size keyboard support (DEL, HOME, END and so on).
- Graphics commands in 40 column mode (CIRCLE, DRAW, PLOT).
- Localisation of character sets, error messages, and keyboard layouts.
- Long variable names.
- Motorola style number entry (%; binary, @; octal, $; hexadecimal).
- NMI BREAK.
- On-entry syntax checking.
- PLAY command with 6-channel PSG and MIDI support.
- Recursive user-defined functions.
- Smart firmware updates.
- Token abbreviation and shortcuts (&; AND, ~; NOT; |; OR, ?; PRINT, '; REM').
- Undo NEW (OLD).
- User-defined channels.
- User-defined character sets (256 characters).
- User-defined macros.
- User-defined screen modes.

[NOTE]
====
For the smart firmware update option to work, SE Basic IV must be installed in the second and third 16K ROM slots.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Using the smart firmware update feature replaces the version of esxDOS you're using with the latest version of UnoDOS 3.

=== SD advanced format (+3e)

ZX Spectrum +3e is one ROM that can be used with ZX Spectrum core. This is an improved Sinclair ZX Spectrum +3, which can use hard disks or memory cards.

+3e uses its own partition format (called IDEDOS), to split de hard disk into several partitions to store data. ROM version 1.28 and later can share IDEDOS partitions with MBR partitions. In other case, you must reserve the whole card for IDEDOS partitions.

[WARNING]
====
The following partition scheme can only be used with ZX Spectrum core.
====

[TIP]
====
Each partition in IDEDOS can be between 1 and 16 Megabytes (16 million bytes) in size, and each disk can have between 1 and 65535 partitions. This means that the maximum space used in a card is about 1 TB.
====

This is one method to split a card into two or three parts, with the first partition IDEDOS (1GB), the second one FAT16 (4GB) and the third one FAT32 (using the remaining space in the card).

exsdos and other programs can be installed into the second partition <<#_esxdos,as explained earlier>>.

==== Windows

You can use Windows Disk Management utility. The steps are:

. Remove all partitions from the card

. Create a new extended partition, using the desired space for IDEDOS

. Create a primary partition, 4GB in size, and format as FAT16

. Optionally, create another primary partition using the remaining space and format as FAT32

==== macOS

You will have to use the command line. The first task is to find out which device is the disk to format:

[source,shell]
----
diskutil list
----

For this example, it will be disk 6:

==== +3e

Once the SD card is ready to use, you can start Spectrum core with a +3e ROM and format the IDEDOS part.

The first step is determine the disk geometry. With the cart inserted into the ZXUNO+, type the command:

[source,basic]
----
CAT TAB
----

This will give a result showing the number of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder-head-sector[cylinders, heads and sectors].

Whith this info, we estimate the size of our partition, using cylinders. For example, if the number of cylinders is 32768, and we want to use 1GB of a 16GB card, the number of cylinders needes would be 32768/16=2048. This way, the IDEDOS partition can be formatted using that number:

[source,basic]
----
FORMAT TO 0,100,2048
----

The first value (`0`) is the drive to use (the first one), the second value is the maximum number of IDEDOS partitions, and the third one yis the number of cylinders to use.

Once formatted, you can create new partitions. For example, to create a 16MB partition with the name "Software", another 4GB partition named "Swap" (to use as swap) and another one name "Utils", 8MB in size:

[source,basic]
----
NEW DATA "Software",16
NEW EXP "Swap1",4
NEW DATA "Utils",8
----

=== esxdos Commands

==== Basic Guide

There are two different kind of esxdos commands, the so-called "DOT" commands, which, as the name suggests, begin with a period, and the commands that are extensions to the existing ones in BASIC.

The main "DOT" commands are the following:

- `128`: To enter 128K mode from within 48K mode
- `cd`: Change current working directory
- `chmod`: Change file attributes
- `cp`: Copy a file
- `divideo`: Play a DivIDEo (.DVO) video file
- `drives`: Show currently available drives
- `dskprobe`: Utility which shows low level content of an storage device
- `dumpmem`: Can dump RAM memory content to a file
- `file`: Tries to recognize the type of data contained in a file (like the UNIX command)
- `gramon`: Monitor to search graphics, sprites, fonts, etc. in RAM memory
- `hexdump`: Shows the contents of a file using hexadecimal notation
- `hexview`: Allow to see and navigate through the contents os a file using hexadecimal notation
- `launcher`: Creates a shortcut (launcher) to open directly a TAP or BAS file
- `ls`: Show the content of a directory
- `lstap`: Show the content of a .TAP file
- `mkdir`: Create a directory
- `mktrd`: Create a .TRD disk file
- `more`: Show the content of a text file
- `mv`: Move a file
- `partinfo`: Show partition information of an storage device
- `playpt3`: Play .PT3 music file
- `playsqt`: Play .SQT music file
- `playstc`: Play .STC music file
- `playtfm`: Play .TFC music file
- `playwav`: Play .WAV audio file
- `rm`: Remove a file or a directory
- `snapload`: Load snapshot file
- `speakcz`: Reads text aloud using czech pronunciation
- `tapein`: Mounts a .TAP file so that it can be used then from BASIC using LOAD sentence
- `tapeout`: Mount a .TAP file so that it can be used then from BASIC using SAVE sentence
- `vdisk`: Mount a .TRD disk file to use with the TR-DOS environment (once all the drives have been mounted, you can enter TR-DOS emulation by typing: `RANDOMIZE USR 15616`)

Some BASIC extended commands are:

- `GO TO` to change the current drive and/or directory (e.g.: `GO TO hd1` or `GO TO hd0"games"`)
- `CAT` to show the content of a drive
- `LOAD` to lad a file from a drive (BASIC Program, SCREEN, CODE, etc. for example `LOAD *"Screen.scr" SCREEN$`)
- `SAVE` to save data in a file (e.g: `SAVE *"Program.bas"`)
- `ERASE` to delete a file

In addition, esxdos also has an NMI manager, an application that loads when NMI is pressed, and lets you browse the SD card and load easily files (TAP, Z80, TRD, etc.). Pressing the "H" key invokes a help screen, which shows all the available keys.

[NOTE]
====
The esxdos manager shows file and directory entries in the order stored in the internal FAT table, and not alphabetically. If you want to see them ordered, you have to reorder the SD card structure with a utility like Fat Sorter for Windows, https://fatsort.sourceforge.io/[FATsort] for Linux and macOS, https://www.luisrios.eti.br/public/en_us/projects/yafs/[YAFS], http://www.trustfm.net/software/utilities/SDSorter.phpp[SDSorter] or other.

==== ZXUNO+ Commands

As explained in the installation part, there are a series of commands that are exclusive to ZXUNO+:

- `back16m`: Dumps to a `FLASH.ZX1` file, in the root directory of the SD card, the contents of a 16 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM. After finishing, it is necessary to execute the command `.ls` so that the cache is written to the card
- `corebios`: To upddate simultaneously ZX Spectrum core and BIOS

- `romsupgr`: Load from a RomPack filel named `ROMS.ZX1`, in the root directory of the SD card, all ZX Spectrum core ROMS into SPI flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM
- `upgr16m`: Load the content of a `FLASH.ZX1` file, in the root directory of the SD card, to a 16 Meg SPI Flash memory. It must be run while using a "root" mode ROM
- `zxuc`: Utility to configure al options of BIOS, which also can be stored in the SD in configuration files that can be loaded later
- `zxunocfg`: Configuration utillity for certain features of ZX-Uno such as timings, contention, keyboard type, CPU speed, video type or vertical frequency

<<<

=== Wi-Fi

The +UNO has an ESP module with a Wi-Fi chip https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266[ESP8266]. It can easily be used with a ZX Spectrum core (e.g., EXP27 160820 core) which has synthesized an https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Asynchronous_Receiver-Transmitter[UART] device, that allows communication with the module.

There are two "DOT" commands for configuring software access to the module. They can be downloaded from https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/SD/BIN/[GitHub official repository]:

- `esprst`, which restarts the module
- `iwconfig`, to register the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password, keeping them in the file `/sys/config/iw.cfg`.

For example:
[source,shell]
----
.iwconfig mywifi mypassword
----

[CAUTION]
====
Since the selected VGA frequency affects the master clock frequency, for the communication between the core and the Wi-Fi module to work correctly, it has to be set at 50 (see the <<#_advanced,BIOS settings chapter>>).
====

==== Network tools for ZX-Uno pack

These are programs, developed by Nihirash and that are available to https://nihirash.net/network-tools-for-zx-uno-pack/[download] https://nihirash.net/ugophy-1-0-and-nettools-for-zx-spectrum/#more-71[from his web].

- `netman`: Utility to configure the ESP Wi-Fi chip for other programs from Nihirash. Does not work in 48K mode
- `uGophy`: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher[Gopher] client. Does not work in 48K mode
- `irc`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat[Internet Relay Chat] client. Works better at 14 Mhz
- `wget`: Utility to download files with HTTP (does not work with HTTPS)
- `platoUNO`: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_Logic_Automated_Teaching_Operations[PLATO] client. Also works better at 14 Mhz. For more information about PLATO, check https://www.irata.online/#about[IRATA.ONLINE] web

==== FTP-Uno

FTP cliente developed by Yombo, available https://github.com/yomboprime/FTP_Uno[at GitHub].

Configuration steps:

. Edit `FTP.CFG` file with all the required information (SSID and password, FTP server, etc.)
. Copy `FTP.CFG` inside `/SYS/CONFIG/` in microSD card
. Also copy `ftpUno.tap` to any place in the card
. Start up the ZX-Uno and load the tape file `ftpUno.tap`

<<<

==== UART Terminal

Program example included with https://github.com/yomboprime/ZXYLib[ZXYLib] C library, developed by yombo, that let's you send directly typed characters using the UART, and also see the result. Available to download https://github.com/yomboprime/ZXYLib/raw/master/UARTTERM.tap[at this link].

Once the file `UARTTERM.tap` is in the card and loaded, you can type several specific commands for ESP8266 chip. For example:

- `AT`. To check if ther is communication. `OK` would be the result if everything is fine
- `AT+RST`. To restart the chip. Exactly what <<#_wi_fi,`esprst`>> command does
- `AT+GMR`. To see some information, like firmware version, etc.
- `AT+CWMODE_CUR=1`. Put temporarily the chip into Wi-Fi client mode, until next restart
- `AT+CWMODE_DEF=1`. Put temporarily the chip into Wi-Fi client mode, and save it as default
- `AT+CWJAP_CUR="<WiFiNetwork>","<WiFiPassword>"`, where `<WiFiNetwork>` Wi-Fi ID of the network to connect to, and `<WiFiPassword>` the access password, connects temporarily to that network
- `AT+CWJAP_DEF="<WiFiNetwork>","<WiFiPassword>"`, connects to the network, and saves the settings as default in the chip flash memory
- `AT+CWAUTOCONN=1` sets the chip to connect automatically on boot to the default network (`AT+CWAUTOCONN=0` disables it)

You can see all the available commands reading the https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/4a-esp8266_at_instruction_set_en.pdf[official documentation].

=== Making RDM (RaDastan Movie) files

The `PLAYRMOV` "DOT" command plays radastanian format video files. To convert your own videos, you need `makevideoradas`, a utility that is available at https://svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/software/modo_radastan/videos_radastanianos/[SVN repository].

If using Windows, there is already an executable file (`makevideoras.exe`). For Linux or macOS, you must have installed command line developer utilities in order to compile an executable

[source,shell]
----
gcc makevideoradas.c -o makevideoradas
----

Apart from `makevdideoradas`, you need another two tools: https://ffmpeg.org[`ffmpeg`] and https://imagemagick.org/index.php[`imagemagick`]. These can be installed with a package manager (`apt`, `yum`, `pacmam`, `brew`, etc.) or downloading the source code and compiling.

Now, the first step to convert our video (for example `myvideo.mp4`), is exporting the frames as 128x96 pixel BMP image files. We create a temporary file (`img` for this example), to store them.

[source,shell]
----
mkdir img
(...)/ffmpeg -i myvideo.mp4 -vf "scale=128:96,fps=25" -start_number 0 img/output%05d.bmp
----

Now we transform the `BMP` files to 16 colours (v3) `BMP` files.

[source,shell]
----
(...)/magick mogrify -colors 16 -format bmp -define bmp:format=bmp3 img/*.bmp
----

Finally, we assemble the `.RDM` file (in this example `myvideo.rdm`) and cleanup the temporary files and directory.

[source,shell]
----
(...)/makevideoradas img/output
mv img/output.rdm ../myvideo.rdm
rm -rf img
----

There is more information about all this process at https://www.zonadepruebas.com/viewtopic.php?t=4796&start=110[this thread in Zona de Pruebas forums].

=== CP/M

There's a Multicomp core for ZX-Uno, which is  CP/M 2.2, or you can run CP/M 3.0 for Spectrum with a +3e ROM and a specially prepared SD card. However, only 51 columns are available, and you will have to be jumping between the left and the right side in order to see all the 80 columns, which is quite cumbersome.

=== FUZIX

FUZIX is a fusion of various elements from http://www.dougbraun.com/uzi.html[UZI] (an implementation of the Unix kernel written for a Z80 based computer), extended from the 7th Edition Unix kernel to somewhere in the SYS3 to SYS5.x world, with bits of POSIX.

It is not yet useful although you can build and boot it and run test application code. A lot of work is still needed on the utilities and libraries.

At the moment of writing these lines, the http://www.fuzix.org[officially built images] do not work with all the ZXUNO+ ZX Spectrum cores. However, building from the source code, does work. The following instructions have been tested with https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/tree/49c09b994c3bbc7c77511452ed188bb875562dee[the latest code on June 2021].

==== How to Build

The following instructions have been made using a clean installation of Fedora Workstation Linux (Fedora 34). Apart from the package installation commands, all the other steps should work with many other Linux distributions.

Install the needed packages:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dnf groupinstall -y 'Development Tools'
sudo dnf install -y gcc-c++ automake boost-devel gputils flex texinfo bison byacc
----

Get the special version of http://sdcc.sourceforge.net[SDCC compiler] for Fuzix, and build it:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/EtchedPixels/sdcc280.git

cd sdcc280
cd sdcc
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ../..
----

Get Fuzix source code:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX.git
cd FUZIX
----

Edit `Makefile` and change the line with `TARGET=` to `TARGET=zxdiv`. Build:

[source,shell]
----
sudo make
----

<<<

Get the esxdos binary and kernel image from this paths:

[source]
----
./Kernel/platform-zxdiv/FUZIX
./Kernel/platform-zxdiv/FUZIX.BIN
----

Build the root filesystem:

[source,shell]
----
cd ./Standalone/filesystem-src
./build-filesystem rootfs 256 65535
cd ../..
----

Get the root filesystem image file from this location:

[source]
----
./Standalone/filesystem-src/rootfs
----

==== How to use

You need a MBR partition table on the SD card. You can set up one or two primary partitions <<#_sd_card_formatting,as usual>> (the first one with a functional esxdos installation), leaving enough space at the end to add one 32MB (Type `7E`) primary partition for the root file system and one 4MB (Type `7F`) primary partition for swap.

Copy the rootfs filesystem to the type `7E` partition. You can use the `dd` utility, included with Linux, macOS, etc. (and also http://www.chrysocome.net/dd[ported to Windows]).

After you find the device name for the `7E` partition, use that as destination for the `rootfs` file. For example, for `/dev/rdisks3`:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dd if=rootfs of=/dev/rdisks3
----

Copy the `FUZIX` command into the `BIN` directory and copy `FUZIX.BIN` to the top level directory of the esxdos partition.

<<<

Boot into a Spectrum core with a 128K ROM and with esxdos, then type '.fuzix', and press `Enter`.

[.text-center]
image:./img/fuzix01.png[scaledwidth=70%]

[TIP]
====
Your keyboard configuration on BIOS should be using an english layout, or you won't be able to type some characters like `|`.
====

After a few seconds, the system should detect the SD card and find the partitions. In this example, the root is the third partition of SD 0.

[.text-center]
image:./img/fuzix02.png[scaledwidth=70%]

<<<

Type the rootfs partition (e.g. `hd3`) and press `Enter`.

[.text-center]
image:./img/fuzix03.png[scaledwidth=70%]

Set up date (press `Enter`) and time (press `Enter`).

[.text-center]
image:./img/fuzix04.png[scaledwidth=70%]

<<<

Login with `root` user and no password.

[.text-center]
image:./img/fuzix05.png[scaledwidth=70%]

Now you have a Fuzix shell.

[TIP]
====
When finished, remember to stop the system using the `shutdown` command or the root filesystem will be marked as not clean, and a filesystem check will be forced on the next Fuzix boot.
====

<<<

== Upgrade

=== BIOS

To update the BIOS, a file named `FIRMWARE.ZX1` (for a ZXUNO+ with an FPGA LX16 board) or `FIRMWARE.ZX1` must be obtained. The latest version of the firmware files can be downloaded from https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/firmware[the official repository]

[WARNING]
====
Updating the firmware (BIOS) is delicate. It should not be done if it is not necessary. If doing so, ensure that the ZXUNO+ has uninterrupted power (such as a UPS or a laptop USB with battery).
====

Copy the file to the root of the SD card, turn on and press `F2` to enter BIOS, select `Upgrade`, choose __"Upgrade BIOS for ZX"__, and then __"SDfile"__. The system will read the file `FIRMWARE...` and notify when finished.

=== ROMs

The flash memory of a ZXUNO+ has reserved 64 slots, 16K each, to store ZX Spectrum ROM images. Thus, an original ZX Spectrum ROM (16K) will take one slot, a ZX Spectrum 128K ROM (32K) will be two slots, and a ZX Spectrum +2A ROM (64K) will need 4 slots.

You can add a new ROM pressing the key `N` at the BIOS <<#_roms,ROMs screen>>, connecting an audio cable to the board, and playing a ROM audio tape. ROM audio tapes can be made from a `.tap` file built with the `GenRom` utility, available at https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/modflash[ZX-Uno Code Repository].

To update at once all the ROMs installed for ZX Spectrum, a RomPack file named `ROMS.ZX1` must be obtained, which must be copied to the SD card. Boot the ZXUNO+ using a "rooted" ROM, and then just enter the command `.romsupgr`. This will burn all the ROMs, which will be available for use.

[NOTE]
====
Remember that <<#_special_keys_and_buttons,if the ZXUNO+ is started while pressing the `/` key>>, then the default ROM of the ZX Spectrum core will be loaded in" root "mode.
====

To do the opposite process (save the ROMs in a RomPack file named `ROMS.ZX1`), you can use the` .romsback` command.

RomPack files can be easily edited with the https://guest:zxuno@svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/software/ZX1RomPack/[ZX1RomPack] utility. Although it is a Windows program, it works perfectly, for example using https://www.winehq.org[Wine] or similar programs, either on macOS or Linux.

<<<

=== Cores

There are a number of available spaces where you can store cores (the number depends on the size of the SPI Flash of the ZXUNO+ model), the first space being reserved for the main ZX Spectrum (this does not prevent having more ZX Spectrum cores in other space as well of the first).

Official cores are https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/cores[available to download] from GitHub repository.

To update or install a new core there are several possibilities.

The easiest way is to obtain the latest version of the file that defines the core, which will be a file that must be named `COREnn.ZX1`, where `nn` is the slot number where to install (for example `CORE.ZX1` or `CORE2.ZX1` for slot 2).

[NOTE]
====
Starting with BIOS version 0.80, files are named using the `COREXXy.ZXn` convention where XX _always_ is a two-digit number. Thus, an old `CORE4.ZX1` file has to be renamed as `CORE04.ZX1`. The `y` part of the name is ignored, so longer and more descriptive names can be used (such as `CORE04_example.ZX1`).
====

Copy the file to the root of the SD card, turn on and press `F2` to enter BIOS. Choose `Upgrade`, select the row corresponding to the chosen core number (for example, 2 - just after Spectrum), press enter and then __" SD file "__. The system will read the file `COREnn ..` and warn when it is updated, although first it will ask for the name (to be shown in the list to choose from at startup and in the BIOS list).

[WARNING]
====
The ZX Spectrum core update is exactly the same as other cores, but instead of the name `CORE1.ZX1`, it has to be a file named `SPECTRUM.ZX1`.
====

=== esxdos

To update esxdos to a new version, the distribution must be obtained from https://www.esxdos.org[the official website].

Once downloaded and extracted, the contents of `BIN` and `SYS` directories have to be copied to the root of the card, merging the existing ones (to preserve the exclusive ZXUNO+ commands).

Copy `ESXMMC.BIN` (or `ESXMMC.ROM`, depending on version) to the root of the SD card.

Start ZXUNO+ with the card inserted and press `F2` to access BIOS setup. Select the `Upgrade` menu and choose __"Upgrade esxdos for ZX"__. In the dialog that appears choose __"SD file"__ and, when it asks __"Load from SD"__ answer __"Yes"__ to the question __"Are you sure?"__. The content of the file `ESXMMC...` will be read, written to the flash storage and you will be notified when it is updated.

Do a Hard-reset, or turn it off and on.

If everything has been done correctly, when you turn on the ZXUNO+ you will see how esxdos detects the card and loads the necessary components to work, showing the new version at the top.

<<<

=== Flash Memory

You also can update all the FPGA flash memory. At this moment, from the BIOS you can only use 16MiB image files.

Copy the image file (16MiB) `FLASH.ZX1` to the root of the SD card.

Turn on the ZXUNO+ and press the `F2` key during boot to access the BIOS setup. Select the menu `Upgrade` and then choos the option __"Upgrade flash from SD"__. Press Enter, choose `Yes`, and press Enter again to start the Flash writing process.

Do a Hard-Reset or turn of and on again.

[WARNING]
====
This process can't be undone, and it will replace all the previously installed cores, the BIOS, the ZX Spectrum ROMs and their configuration with the data in the image file.
====

<<<

== Other cores

=== ZX Spectrum EXP27

Based on the source of EXP27-160820 core by mcleod_ideafix, with some modifications (by Spark2k06, Neuro, Yombo and azesmbog):

- Different colour modes including monochrome
- Option to enable or disable the Wi-Fi addon
- Modified activation of Turbo Boost Mode
- Gest back the option to use custom marks in PZX, just like the first T24 unofficial core did (without SAA1099)
- SAA1099 audio chip (without PZX)

There are two differente versions of the core, one with PZX support and no SAA1099 audio chip, and another one with SAA1099 chip but without PZX support.

==== SD card format

You may use a SD card with the first partition formatted as FAT16 or FAT32, and inside, an esxdos distribution matching the version installed in BIOS (see the <<#_esxdos,esxdos corresponding section>> for more info).

See the <<#_cores,corresponding section>> for instructions of how to install this alternative core in ZXUNO+.

<<<

==== Keyboard

===== Special keys and buttons

While the core is running:

- `End`: Switches between colour, green monochrome, amber monochrome and black and white
- `F6` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+6` on +UNO): Sets up a custom mark at the current PZX position (only in the version with PZX support)
- `F7: PXC Play/Pause (only in the version with PZX support)
- `F8: Moves the PZX position to a the custom mark (only in the version with PZX support)
- `CTRL+ F8: Rewinds the PZX position to a "tag BRWS" mark. These marks are used, for example, to label where a multiload starts (only in the version with PZX support)
- `F9: Stops playing the PZX and set the position back to the beginning (only in the version with PZX support)
- `F11` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+Q` on +UNO): Enabe or disable the Wi-Fi module
- `F12` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+W` on +UNO): Enable or disable 28 MHz CPU speed.

The PZX player will stop when it gets to the end of the file, or if it finds a STOP mark, or if it finds a STOP IF IN 48K mark and the core is in 48K mode (no 128K pagination).

[TIP]
====
You can add BRWS and STOP marks to a PZX file using the program https://zx-modules.de/?page_id=2[ZX-BlockEditor], which is part of de https://zx-modules.de[ZX-Modules].

=== ZX Spectrum TBBlue

The https://github.com/fbelavenuto/TBBlue[TBBlue] firmware, was created by Victor Trucco and Fabio Belavenuto on en 2016. Originally thought to use a Z80 processor, it was changed afterwards to usa Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA, to add some more advanced features. This the base for https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum_Next[ZX Spectrum Next].

The lates ZX-Uno TBBlue core is a version synthesized by azesmbog from the latest versions of the reposityr and has, among other, these features:

- Composite video/RGB and VGA video output
- SD support, with DivMMC
- Turbo Mode
- Timex Mode
- ULAPlus
- Multiface support
- Joystick support
- Turbosound
- Spectrum ROM selection on boot
- Tree AY audio chips (as on ZX Spectrum Next), added by azesmbog
- SID sound chip, added by azesmbog

==== SD card format

An SD card with the first partition in FAT16 or FAT32 format is needed with, optionally, the esxdos distribution that matches the current BIOS configuration (see the <<#_esxdos,esxdos corresponding section>> for more info).

Obtain the TBBlue distribution that matches the core version, for example, looking in https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=491[ZX-Uno forums]. Usuaally, the structure is something like this:

----
   /
   +-TBBLUE/
   |  +-128.rom
   |  (...)
   |  +-config.ini
   |  (...)
   |  +-esxmmc.rom
   |  (...)
   |
   +-TBBLUE.FW
----

[TIP]
====
If you are using a SD card with <<#_esxdos,esxdos>>, the `esxmmc.rom` file version must match the one of the SD card.

=== Acorn Atom

https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Atom[Acorn Atom] was a home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd. The ZXUNO+ core is an adaptation of the https://github.com/hoglet67/AtomFpga[AtomFPGA] project. You can get more information at https://zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4[ZX-Uno Forums].

==== SD card format

You have to use a SD card with the first partition in FAT16 format.

Download the latest version of Atom Software Archive https://github.com/hoglet67/AtomSoftwareArchive/releases/latest[from GitHub].

You can set up the files in the SD in two different ways:

. Extract all the contents of the archive to the root of the SD card. `SYS` directory contents are compatible with esxdos `SYS` directory, so you can merge both into one.

. Have less files an directories in the root directory. Create a directory named `ATOM` in the SD root, and copy inside all the uncompressed archive content, except for the directory `MANPAGES` which must also be in root. Then, extract and the files from `trick_ATOM_folder` archive (available https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4006[at ZX-Uno Forum]), replacing any file with the same name. You will get a file and directory structure like this:

----
        /
        +-ATOM/
        |  +-AA/
        |  (...)
        |  +-AGD/

        |  +-TUBE/
        |  | +-BOOT6502
        |  (..)
        |
        +-MANPAGES/
        |  +-CPM.MAN
        |  +-FLEX.MAN
        |  (...)
        |
        +-MENU

=== Acorn Electron

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Electron[Acorn Electron] was a budget version of the BBC Micro educational/home computer. The core is based on https://github.com/hoglet67/ElectronFpga[David Banks (hoglet) original works].

Main features:

- Composite video/RGB and VGA 50Hz video output
- SD support with ".MMB" files
- Software loading via ZXUNO+ audio in port
- PS/2 keyboard

==== SD card format

An SD card with the first partition in FAT16 or FAT32 format is needed to load software from it. A special ROM inside the core (Smart SPI)
reads a special file with disk images inside.

The file must have the name `BEEB.MMB` and it has to be in the root directory. You can make one with `MMBImager` for Windows, available at https://guest:zxuno@svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/cores/Acorn_electron/test1/varios/[ZX-Uno SVN Repository] (Usuario `guest`, contraseÃ±a `zxuno`) or with MMB/SSD Utils in perl, available at https://github.com/sweharris/MMB_Utils[GitHub].

The file has to be whole across the SD (not fragmented). You can use a program that can defrag files or FAT filesystems (like https://www.ccleaner.com/defraggler[Defraggler for Windows]) or use the following method:

. Format the first SD partition using FAT16 or FAT32, but *NOT with quick format* (when using Windos, uncheck that option).
. Copy `BEEM.MB` making sure it is the *FIRST file* being copied.
. If you want you can add any other file to the SD (e.g. for using with other cores), but keep *ALWAYS* `BEEB.MMB` as the first file copied to the card.

[TIP]
====
Since the `MMB` file has the same name as the one for <<#_bbc_micro,BBC Micro core>>, you can use another core with full access to the SD card (like a a ZX Spectrum core with esxdos), with both `MMB` files with a different name, and then rename the one for Acorn Electron as `BEEB.MMB` before running this core
====

==== Keyboard

===== Special keys and buttons

While the core is running:

- `Scroll Lock`: Switches between composite and VGA video.
- `Ctrl+Shift+1` to `Ctrl+Shift+4`: Use other graphic modes (60Hz, etc)
- `F10` and `Ctrl+F10`: Soft Reset
- `Ctrl+Alt+Backspace` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+B` on +UNO): Hard reset. Backspace is the delete key, located in the top-right portion of the keyboard, above `Enter`

=== Amstrad CPC 6128

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC#CPC6128[Amstrad CPC 6128] was the successor to the Amstrad CPC 664 (only produced for approximately six months), and this one, was the sucessor to the Amstrad CPC 464.

ZXUNO+ Amstrad CPC 6128 core is based on the http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/FPGAmstrad[FPGAmstrad] project by Renaud HÃ©lias.

Some of its features are:

- VGA: 640x480 VGA centered at 60Hz
- Disk selection: The first disk image detected is inserted on startup, and pressing a key makes a reset and loads the next one

==== SD card format

You have to use a SD card with the first partition in FAT32 format (`0B` Win95 FAT-32 Partition Type), with a maximum of 4GB in size, and 4096 bytes per cluster.

You also need the following ROM files (they are available http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/FPGAmstrad#How_to_assemble_it[at the original project Wiki]) or from the https://github.com/renaudhelias/FPGAmstrad/raw/master/OS6128_BASIC1-1_AMSDOS_MAXAM.zip[GitHub repository]:

- `OS6128.ROM`
- `BASIC1-1.ROM`
- `AMSDOS.ROM`
- `MAXAM.ROM`

It is also recommended to copy one or more disk image files (`DSK`) with the software that you want to run.

Copy all `ROM` and `DSK` files to the root directory of the FAT32 partition.

==== Keyboard

===== Special keys and buttons

During core execution:

- `Page Up`: Reset the Amstrad computer and load the next `DSK` file alphabetically

=== Apple I

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I[Apple I], or Apple-1, was one of the first desktop computers, and te first to combine a microprocessor with a keyboard connection and a monitor.

The ZX-Uno core has been made by Subcritical, using the https://github.com/alangarf/apple-one[Apple-One] project as a basis.

Som of its features are:

- PS/2 keyboard (english layout)
- Only VGA output
- Integer Basic included

==== SD card format

This core does not use the SD card.

==== Keyboard

The keyboard uses an english layout.

Take note that, on an Apple I, there is no delete key. Due to the way that the video signal is made, it is not possible to make the cursor come back to delete a character, so instead, a special one is used: `_`. This means that the text has gone back to delete from the data input (for example `PRN_INT` is interpreted as `PRINT`).

==== Basic Guide

Upon start, the Apple I  boots with https://www.sbprojects.net/projects/apple1/wozmon.php[Woz Monitor] (ROM loaded at `0xFF00`)

[.text-center]

- VGA Scanlines
- Can change monitor between colour and monochrome

For more info check https://zxuno.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=41[ZX-Uno forum].

==== SD card formatting

The SD card needs an exclusive format, so it cannot be used with other cores. It's based on concatenating `NIB` disk image file data.

To convert disk images from other format (`DSK` or `DO`), you can use `dsk2nib` utility, available in https://guest:zxuno@svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/cores/Apple2_spartan6/test3/roms/[ZX-Uno SVN repository] (User `guest`, password `zxuno`) and https://github.com/slotek/dsk2nib[GitHub].

[WARNING]
====
This process can't be undone, and it will remove any content that there was previously in the SD card.
====

===== Windows

Concatenate the disk images (with a maximum of 20) using `COPY`:

[source,shell]
----
COPY /B image1.nib + image2.nib + (...) + image20.nib apple2_20discs.img
----

Dump the new file to the SD card, for example, using http://hddguru.com/software/HDD-Raw-Copy-Tool/[HDD Raw Copy Tool].

===== macOS and Linux

Concatenate the disk images (with a maximum of 20) using `cat`:

[source,shell]
----
cat imagen.nib image2.nib (...) image20.nib > apple2_20discs.img
----

Dump the new file to the SD card, using `dd`:

[source,shell]
----
sudo umount /dev/...
sudo dd if=apple2_20discs.img of=/dev/...
----

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro[BBC Micro], was a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company in the 1980s for the BBC Computer Literacy Project, operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation.

The ZX-Uno core has been made by Quest and enhanced after by azesmbog and hoglet.

Some of its features are:

- RGB and VGA (with optional scanlines) video output
- SD/MMC support, using `.MMB` files
- PS/2 keyboard
- Joystick support on port 1 (Emulating an analog joy)
- sn76489 sound chip implementation from https://github.com/wsoltys/pacedev[PACE project] (Programmable Arcade Circuit Emulation)

==== SD card format

An SD card with the first partition in FAT16 or FAT32 format is needed to load software. A special ROM inside the core (MMFS in the more recent core versions, Smart SPI on older ones) which reads a `BEEB.MMB` file with disk images inside.

The file must have the name `BEEB.MMB` and it has to be in the root directory. You can make one with `MMBImager` for Windows, available at https://guest:zxuno@svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/cores/Acorn_electron/test1/varios/[ZX-Uno SVN Repository] (Usuario `guest`, contraseÃ±a `zxuno`) or with MMB/SSD Utils in perl, available at Github https://github.com/sweharris/MMB_Utils[here] or https://github.com/sweharris/MMB_Utils[here].

The file has to be whole across the SD (not fragmented). You can use a program that can defrag files or FAT filesystems (like https://www.ccleaner.com/defraggler[Defraggler for Windows]) or use the following method:

. Format the first SD partition using FAT16 or FAT32, but *NOT with quick format* (when using Windos, uncheck that option).

. If you want you can add any other file to the SD (e.g. for using with other cores), but keep *ALWAYS* `BEEB.MMB` as the first file copied to the card.

[TIP]
====
Since the `MMB` file has the same name as the one for <<#_acorn_electron,Acorn Electron core>>, you can use another core with full access to the SD card (like a a ZX Spectrum core with esxdos), with both `MMB` files with a different name, and then rename the one for BBC Micro as `BEEB.MMB` before running this core

From within BASIC, you can load from a external tape (or <<#_miniduino,other external audio device>>) with commands like:

[source]
----
TAPE n
LOAD "NAME"
----

Where `n` is a number (between 1 and 5), and `NAME` is mandatory, and the name of the program to load.

If you don't know the name to load, you can guess with the same command sequence, but writing `LOAD ""`.

Binary files are loaded with `MLOAD` instead of `LOAD`.

[NOTE]
====
Maxduino, which is used in <<#_miniduino,miniduino>> does not, at this moment, native support for Lynx tape files.
====

You can use programs like  <<#_audio_file_conversion,Lynx2Wav>> with Lynx `TAP` files. The resulting audio files can be embedded inside of TSX or TZX with tools like <<#_making_tzx_or_tsx_files_from_other_formats,MakeTSX or RetroConverter>>.

The http://retrowiki.es/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=200036835[lince] script makes all this process easier, creating directly Maxduino `TZX` compatible files from Lynx `TAP` files.

=== CHIP-8

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8[CHIP-8] is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. Erik Bryntse later created another interpreter based on CHIP-8, called SCHIP, S-CHIP or Super-Chip which extended the CHIP-8.

The ZXUNO+ core is based on an existing  https://bitbucket.org/csoren/fpga-chip8/[FPGA implementation] of the SuperChip.

There are several sites like https://johnearnest.github.io/chip8Archive/[CHIP-8 Archive] ot https://github.com/mattmikolay/chip-8[Matthew Mikolay's CHIP-8] where you can obtain osftware for these machines.

==== SD card format

You can use a SD card with the first partition in FAT16 or FAT32 formata to store `BIN` or `CH8` ROM files to load with the core.

==== Keyboard

The CHIP-8 machine uses an hexadecimal keyboard as input. This is the key mapping:

[align="center",width="25%",%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Chip-8|PS/2
|`1 2 3 C`|`1 2 3 4`
|`4 5 6 D`|`Q W E R`
|`7 8 9 E`|`A S D F`
|`A 0 B F`|`Z X C V`

- Extra FF port, with a beeper
- Included SDOS v8.4 by PVV, to load `CAS` files from the SD card
- Composite video/RGB and VGA video output

==== SD card format

You can use a SD card with the first partition in FAT16 format, where you can store `.CAS` files, but with some limitations:

- Only machine code `CAS` programs. BASIC programs arenÂ´t supported
- In order to use `CMD` programs, they have to be converted previously to `CAS` with some utility like `trld`, `trs80-tool` or `cmd2cas`
- SDOS only understands `CAS` binary format files (beysikovsky format is not supported)

image:img/ht1080z.png[scaledwidth=70%]

[TIP]
====
After the BASIC interpreter has loaded, if, for example, you type `PRINT MEM`, the available memory for BASIC will be displayed.
====

To load tape files from the SD card, you have to start SDOS typing

[source,basic]
----
>SYSTEM
*? /61440
----

or, if you don't want the screen to be cleared

[source,basic]
----
>SYSTEM
*? /61443
----

[.text-center]
image:img/ht1080z_2.png[scaledwidth=70%]

After that, with instructions like `CD` and `DIR` you can access where the `CAS` file to load is located. Then, to load a `.CAS` file, you only have to type the name, without extension (for example, for a file named `GAME.CAS` you have to type `GAME`).

[TIP]
====
All SDOS commands have to be typed in uppercase.
====

[TIP]
====
Pressing `Space` pauses the listing of files and directories, and pressing any other key afterwards, resumes it.
====

[NOTE]
====
The included ROM has already implemented the Radio Shack Lower Case Kit. However, in order to use lowercase from BASIC, you must load from SD the Upper/Lower Case Driver (file `ULCBAS.CAS`).

=== Jupiter ACE

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Ace[Jupiter ACE]  was a british micro computer produced by Jupiter Cantab in the early 1980s.

The ZX-Uno core has been developed by McLeod and enhanced by Azesmbog, and has, amongst others, the following features:

- Tape loading using the audio input
- Tape loading from the SD card (with https://zx-pk.ru/threads/29892-sd-karta-i-sdos-dlya-8i-bitnykh-pk.html[SDOS])

==== SD card format

You can use a SD card with the first partition in FAT16 format, where you can store Jupiter ACE `.TAP` files, which you can get, for example at the https://www.jupiter-ace.co.uk/index.html[Jupiter ACE Archive] website.

==== Keyboard

===== Special keys and buttons

While the core is running:

- `F1` to `F4`: Turbo Modes
- `F12` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+W` on +UNO): Soft Reset
- `Ctrl+Alt+F5`: NMI
- `Ctrl+Alt+Del` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+N` on +UNO): Reset
- `Ctrl+Alt+Backspace` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+B` on +UNO): Hard reset. Backspace is the delete key, located in the top-right portion of the keyboard, above `Enter`

<<<

==== Basic Guide

From within Forth, you can load from a external tape (or <<#_miniduino,other external audio device>>) with the comand `LOAD <nombre>`.

[CAUTION]
====
Jupiter ACE `TAP` files are different from the ZX Spectrum ones, so, to use then with a miniduino, they have to be converted previously to `TZX` with the `acetap2zx` utility available at https://guest:zxuno@svn.zxuno.com/svn/zxuno/software/jupiter_ace/utils[ZX-Uno repository] (User `guest`, password `zxuno`).
====

To load tape files from the SD card, you have to acces first to SDOS typing

[source,basic]
----
61440 call
----

After that, with instructions like `CD` and `DIR` you can access where the `TAP` file to load is located. Then, to load a `.TAP` file, you only have to type the name, without extension (for example, for a file named `GAME.TAP` you have to type `GAME`).

[TIP]
====
All SDOS commands have to be typed in uppercase.
====

Once the tape has finished loading, type the corresponding command to start the program.

[NOTE]
====
Instead of BASIC like other systems, Jupiter ACE uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth[Forth]. To see the commands currently available (including those that will start a program loaded from tape, you have to type `vlist`.

=== MSX

MSX1FPGA is a project to clone MSX1 in FPGA. The original development is by Fabio Belavenuto and is available https://github.com/fbelavenuto/msx1fpga[at GitHub].

Some of its features are:

- MSX1 at 50Hz or 60Hz
- 128K Nextor (MSX-DOS2 evolution) ROM with SD driver
- Reconfigurable keyboard map
- Scanlines
- Joystick support

==== SD card format

You have to use a SD card with the first partition in FAT16 format with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type[code `0x06` (16-bit FAT)]. You can also use a second FAT16 partition for MSX software, and leaving the first one only for the system startup.

You need to get:

- Basic SD project files SD https://github.com/fbelavenuto/msx1fpga/tree/master/Support/SD[from GitHub]
- Nextor driver (`NEXTOR.SYS`) and ROM (`NEXTOR.ROM`) https://github.com/fbelavenuto/msx1fpga/tree/master/Software/nextor[also from GitHub]
- MSX1 ROM (`MSX_INT.rom`, `MSX_JP.rom` or `MSX_USA.rom`) https://github.com/fbelavenuto/msx1fpga/tree/master/Software/msx1[at the same repository]

Copy the contents of the https://github.com/fbelavenuto/msx1fpga/tree/master/Support/SD[SD directory] in the root of the first partition of the SD.

Copy `NEXTOR.SYS` to the same place.

Copy `NEXTOR.ROM` inside the `MSX1FPGA` directory.

Copy one MSX1 ROM (`MSX_INT.rom`, `MSX_JP.rom` or `MSX_USA.rom`) inside the `MSX1FPGA` directory, but renaming it to `MSX1BIOS.ROM`.

The file `/MSX1FPGA/config.txt` keeps the core configuration, using this format:

----
11SP01
||||||
|||||+-Scanlines: 1=Enabled, 0=Disabled
||||+--Turbo: 1=Initialize with turbo enabled
|||+---Colour System: N=NTSC, P=PAL
||+----Keymap: E=English, B=Brazilian, F=Francese, S=Spanish, J=Japanese
|+-----Scandoubler(VGA): 1=Enabled, 0=Disabled
+------Nextor: 1=Enabled, 0=Disabled

=== MZ-700

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ[MZ-700] was a personal computer sold by Sharp. It included keyboard and tape-based recorder in a single unit.

The ZX-Uno core has been made by jepalza, based on en http://www.retropc.net/ohishi/mzbyfpga/index.htm[previous implementations].

Some features of the core are:

- Only VGA video mode output
- Tape loading using the audio input
- PS/2 keyboard support trying to mimic the original keyboard layout

[WARNING]
====
Since it is an experimental core, there are some problems. For example, the SRAM tends to get corrupted after some time of use. At this moment, the best option is to turn off and on the ZXUNO+ when this happens
====

[TIP]
====
You can use the https://original.sharpmz.org/mzf2wav.htm[mzf2wav] utility, available for Windows, and with source code valid for Linux and Mac, to convert `MZF` tape files to `WAV` and load them with a external audio device
====

==== SD card format

This core does not use the SD card

<<<

==== Keyboard

The core tries to keep the original machine keys layout.

===== Special keys and buttons

While the core is running:

- `F1` to `F5`: F1 to F5
- `Esc`: `GRAPH`
- `Tab`: `ALPHA`
- `Shift Lock`: `CTRL`
- `Shift`: `SHIFT`
- `Backspace`: `BREAK`
- `Enter`: `CR`
- `Insert`: `INS`
- `Del`: `DEL`
- `Cursor keys`: `Cursor keys`

==== Basic Guide

You *must* use two jump wires to expansion port pins `P58` and `P51`, both connected to `GND`:

[.text-center]
image:img/mz700puente.jpg[scaledwidth=70%]

The MZ-700 had switches to determine the tape status (PLAY) and the country code. The core uses EXT9(`P51`) for PLAY and EXT6(`P58`) for the country. They are both needed since there are some games that use the japanese character set (wire to `P58` *not* connected) or the european character set (wire to `P58` connected), and because the tape loading routines detect the status (`P51` *not connected*, `Stop` mode, `P51` *connected*, `Play` mode).

As a default `P58` *must* be connected to `GND`. You can turn it off for a japanese character set program.

Likewise, `P51` *must* be connected to `GND` to load from tape. Some programs need to disconnect it after finishing loading.

For most software, you can leave always connected both wires.

<<<

After startup the default MZ-700 ROM has a very basic monitor with a few commands, like LOAD (L), SAVE (S), DUMP (D), etc. Afterwards, you can load from tape machine code programs or a language interpreter (BASIC, Forth, Pascal) and then load a program in the selected language.

To load a tape from the monitor with a (u <<#_miniduino,external audio device>>):

With, at least, `P51` connected to `GND`, type `L` y `Enter` and the start the audio tape.

[.text-center]
image:img/mz700load.png[scaledwidth=70%]

You can hear the audio while loading the tape. Take note, that, since the core isn't finished, there are many programs that do not work. Usually small programas load better.

=== NES

Nintendo Entertainment System (also known as Nintendo NES or just NES) is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System[second home video game console produced by Nintendo].

The ZXUNO+ core has been made by https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1245[DistWave and Quest], based on https://github.com/strigeus/fpganes[Ludde/Strigeus NES core forNexys4 board].

Some features of this core are:

- Only VGA video mode is supported, with non-accurate timings, so it may not work with some displays
- HQ2X filters that "removes pixels" from the image
- Scanlines simulation
- Made with NES NTSC clock timings, so only USA ROMs run fine. PAL ROMs run faster than they should
- You can load ROMs from the SD
- It uses all 512 KB ZXUNO+ SRAM. It's split into two 256 KB banks, uno for PRG_ROM and the other for CHR_ROM. So any ROM using more than 256 KB for CHR or PRG won't work. Obviously any ROM bigger than 512 KB won`t work too.
- Joystick support

==== SD card format

You need a SD card with the first partition in FAT16 format to store ROM image files of the games to load. ROM files can be inside subdirectories.

See the <<#_cores,corresponding section>> for instructions of how to install the NES core in ZXUNO+.

==== Keyboard

===== Special keys and buttons

While the core is running:

- `Esc` or joystick button 2: Show or hide configuration menu
- Cursor keys, and `Enter` to use the menu
- `Ctrl+Alt+Backspace` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+B` on +UNO): Hard reset

There are alternate versions of this core, which can also be controlled with a keyboard:

- `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` (customizable) or joystick 1: Directional controls for player 1
- `F` and `R` (customizable) or joystick 1 fire buttons: Player 1 A and B buttons
- `5` y `1`: `Select` and `Start` (Player 1)
- `I`, `J`, `K`, `L` (customizable) or joystick 2: Directional controls for player 2
- `H`, `Y` (customizable) or joystick 2 fire buttons: Player 2 A and B button
- `6` y `2`: `Select` and `Start` (Player 1)
- `F4` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+4` on +UNO): Swap the keyboard keys for player 1 and player 2
- `Ctrl+Alt+Backspace` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+B` on +UNO): Hard reset. Backspace is the delete key, located in the top-right portion of the keyboard, above `Enter`

===== Control customization

You can customize the core default controls, creating one or two files in the root of the SD card. The file has to be named `KEYSP1` for player 1 and `KEYSP2` for player 2 (you can obtain a sample file from https://www.zxuno.com/forum/download/file.php?id=1360[ZX-Uno forums]).

These files can be made with an hex editor (like https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/[HxD for Windows]) and contain a byte sequence with this order: `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Button A`, `Button B`. The codes to use are available at the <<#_scan_codes,Scan Codes>> table at the end of this manual (MAKE column), taking into account that if the code is paired with `0xE0`, the other value has to be used, adding `0x80` (e.g. for `E0 14`, it would be `0x94`).

[TIP]
====
For example, the sequence `15 1C 44 4D 29 22` would match `Q A O P Space X`, and the sequence `1D 1B 23 2B 1A 22` would be `W S D F Z X`
====

<<<

==== Basic Guide

Pressing `Esc` or joystick button 2 shows or hides the configuration menu. To navigate the menu and activate or choose any option, use the cursor keys and `Enter`.

[.text-center]

The following options are available:

- Reset NES
- Scanlines
- HQ2X Filter
- P1 Select
- P1 Start
- Load ROM
- Exit

=== Oric Atmos

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oric#Oric_Atmos[Oric Atmos] was the name used by UK-based Tangerine Computer Systems for one 6502-based home computer sold in the 1980s, primarily in Europe.

It has been https://github.com/Kyp069/atmos[developed by Kyp069] and has these features:

- VGA / RGB video Out
- NMI
- DOS-8D (based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravetz_computers#8-bit_architecture[Pravetz 8d], a bulgarian clone of Oric Atmos)

For more information, see https://zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=7[the ZX-Uno forum].

==== SD card format

The SD card needs an exclusive format, so it cannot be used with other cores. It's based on concatenating `NIB` disk image file data. To convert disk images from other format (`DSK` or `DO`), you can use `dsk2nib` utility (the resulting image files must be 232960 bytes long).

[WARNING]
====
This process can't be undone, and it will remove any content that there was previously in the SD card.
====

===== Windows

Concatenate the disk images (with a maximum of 20) using `COPY`:

[source,shell]
----
COPY /B image1.nib + image2.nib + (...) + image20.nib oric_discs.img
----

Dump the new file to the SD card, for example, using http://hddguru.com/software/HDD-Raw-Copy-Tool/[HDD Raw Copy Tool].

===== macOS and Linux

Concatenate the disk images (with a maximum of 20) using `cat`:

[source,shell]
----
cat imagen.nib image2.nib (...) image20.nib > oric_discs.img
----

You can also find several pre-made images at https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=56[ZX-Uno forum page] and https://www.forofpga.es/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=120[ZXDOS+ forums].

[CAUTION]
====
**Do not use any FAT reordering utility** since, this may stop DOS from booting.
====

[WARNING]
====
Some files and directories used by MSXDOS have the same names, so it's not recommended to use the same SD card for <<#_msx,MSX>> and PC XT cores.
====

See the <<#_cores,corresponding section>> for instructions of how to install the PC XT core in Zx-Uno.

<<<

==== Keyboard

===== Special keys and buttons

The following +UNO keyboard combinations are obtained while in `PCXT` mode (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+U` and then `9`). Please read <<#_uno_keyboard,the section dedicated to +UNO keyboard modes>> for more information.

While the core is running:

- `Ctrl+Alt+Scroll Lock`: Change between Green, amber, and black and white modes
- `Ctrl+Alt+KeyPad -`: Throttle down speed

== Other Hardware

=== ESPJoy

include::espjoy_en.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

<<<

=== Rotary Encoders

The Pong core supports the use of quadrature https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder[rotary encoders] as control devices. They can be connected to joystick ports. Although the testing has been done with 600 ppr encoders, lower ppr encoders, like 400 or 300, should also work.

You can also use an Atari 2600 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_(game_controller)[paddle] driving controller. In this case the playing experience is bad, since they have few ppr and you must do several full rotations. When using them, it's recommended to set the accuracy setting to 8, to have enough speed.

==== Connection

The joystick adapter must have pin 5 connected to positive VCC, used as main power, and pin 8 as GND. The rotary encoders to use must support voltage from 3,4v to 5v.

A rotary encoder has 5 wires: Earth Ground (not connected), Vcc (`+`), GND (`0V`or `-`), `A` and `B`.

`A` and `B` are connected to pins 1 and 2 for the first encoder, 3 and 4 for the second one. This way you can have up to 4 encoders connected using both joystick ports.

[.text-center]
image:img/db9joy.png[scaledwidth=40%]

This way, the connections should be:

. Line `A` encoder 1
. Line `B` encoder 1
. Line `A` encoder 2
. Line `B` encoder 2
. Vcc(`+`)
. Fire 1
. NC
. `GND`
. Fire 2

<<<

==== Pong Core Configuration

Follow these directions to choose the configuration:

- For 1 or 2 endoders on joystick port 2 de joystick, select `1/2 Paddle in J2` option
- For 2 encoders, one for each joystick port, select `2/4 Paddle in J1&J2` option. This is also valid to connect two Atari 2600 driving paddles
- For 4 encoders, two for each joystick port, select `2/4 Paddle in J1&J2` option
- For 1 or 2 encoders on joystick port 2 along with a mouse (in this case the encoders are for players 2 and 4), select `Mouse PS/2` option

It is recommended to wait, and make the connection after selecting the chosen option, since the encoders interfere with the up/down directions of the joystick, blocking access to the menu. Another option is to add a on/off switch for the encoder that will disable the power.

<<<

=== Loading from tape

Some cores can load, as the original machines could, from a external audio device like a cassette player or something else simulating it.

Besides the card, you have to plug an appropriate audio cable to <<#_ports_and_connectors,ZXUNO+ audio input>>. It must have a 3.5 mm stereo jack on one side, and two mono outputs on the other side (one for each audio channel). The right audio mono is connected to the audio player (this is not necessary with a miniduino, since it already uses only the right audio channel when playing).

==== Cassette Player

The use is exactly the same as when using the original computers:

. Plug the audio cable
. Type on the computer or select the tape loading option. For example, for ZX Spectrum 48K, typing `J`, then, twice, `"` and then `Enter` to do the classic `LOAD "" + Enter`
. Start playing the tape (you may have to try several times adjusting the player volume)

==== Computer

Depending on the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) there are several programs that can either play a tape file (`TAP`, `TZX`, `PZX`, etc.) and output the sound through a headphone output, or create an audio file (`WAV`, `VOC`, `AU`, etc.) that can be played using a music or audio program.

===== PlayTZX

This program for Windows, macOS or Linux, can play directly a `TZX` tape file through the audio output of the computer.

You can download the binary file (for example), for Windows from https://worldofspectrum.net/utilities/#tzxtools[World of Spectrum Classic] and for Mac from https://github.com/kounch/playtzx/releases[this GitHub repository]) or compile the source code as <<#_compile_source_code_macos_or_linux,explained later>>.

. Plug the audio cable between the computer audio output and ZXUNO+ audio input (remember to use only the right mono channel to the PC, Mac, etc. output)
. Type on the computer or select the tape loading option. For example, for ZX Spectrum 48K, typing `J`, then, twice, `"` and then `Enter` to do the classic `LOAD "" + Enter`
. Start playing a tape file with this command (you may have to try several times adjusting the player volume)

[source,shell]
----
./playtzx <tape file path>
----

<<<

If everything works fine, you will see at the shell the name of the different tape data blocks, while the sound is played and the ZXUNO+ core loads the program.

[TIP]
====
On Linux, the program uses as output the device `/dev/dsp`, this may require to load a module like `snd_pcm_oss` (on systems using ALSA).
====

====== Compile source code (macOS or Linux)

To compile, the first thing is checking that the developer tools are installed on the system, including a C compiler (`gcc`, `clang`, command line developer tools for Mac, etc.) and https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system[GNU Autotools].

Download the source code https://github.com/kounch/playtzx[from this repository]), extract the contents if needed and access from a terminal to the directory and type the commands:

[source,shell]
----
aclocal && autoconf && autoheader && automake --add-missing
./configure
make
----

If all goes well, a new file named `playtzx` will be created, which you can copy anywhere and then use. You can delete the compilation directory.

==== Mobile phone, tablet, MP3 player, etc.

There are a very few apps (or none) that can directly play a tape file on a mobile device so, in many cases, the only option is to convert it to an audio file before playing it.

https://zxtape.net is a website, mobile device compatible, which can play TZP and TZX files

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baltazarstudios.playzxtapes[PlayZX] is an App for Android which can play tape files through the headphone output.

[WARNING]
====
The latest devices with headphone output are normally designed to work with impedances of only a few Ohms. This may, sometimes, not be enough for the ZXUNO+ audio input.

In these cases, it's recommended (if possible) to disable headphone volume limitations and/or use a headphone amplifier that can give a higher impedance.
====

<<<

===== Audio file conversion

These are some of the many programs that exist and which can export tape files to audio files.

https://www.alessandrogrussu.it/tapir/index.html[Tapir] is a GUI program for Windows (but which can also run with Wine on Linux or Mac) that can load `TZX` and `TAP` files and export to `WAV` audio.

`tape2wav` from https://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/[Fuse Utilities] is a command line utility that can export from `TZX` `PZX` and `TAP` to `WAV`.

`pzx2wav` in http://zxds.raxoft.cz/pzx.html[PZX Tools] is another command line utility which exports to `WAV`.

`tsx2wav` in https://github.com/nataliapc/MSX_devs/tree/master/TSXphpclass[TSXphpclass] is made with PHP and that can export from `TSX` to `WAV`.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/wav-prg/files/audiotap/2.2/[Audiotap] is a graphical interface program made for Windows (but also working on Wine) that can convert Commodore `TAP` files to `WAV` audio files.

http://retrowiki.es/viewtopic.php?f=110&t=200037282[Comodoro 2.0] it's a script which can convert to `TAP` and `TZX` files for Commodore Pet, VIC-20, 16 and 64.

https://github.com/RW-FPGA-devel-Team/lynx2wav[Lynx2Wav] is a program that can convert Camputers Lynx `TAP` files to `WAV` audio.

https://github.com/rcmolina/CamputersLYNX[2lynx2wav] also can convert Camputers Lynx `TAP` files to audio files.

https://github.com/kounch/cgc2wav[cgc2wav] can convert EACA Colour Genie `CAS` files to `WAV` audio.

https://docs.mamedev.org/tools/castool.html[castool], available with https://www.mamedev.org[MAME] can convert many kinds of tape file data to `WAV` audio.

== Troubleshooting

=== Firmware images management

There are several tools with you can use to make and/or edit the contents of `ZX1`, `ZX2`, `ZXD` files.

==== zx123_tool

This is a tool to analyze, extract and inject data in SPI flash image files for ZX-Uno, ZXDOS and similar devices.

You need to have https://www.python.org/[Python 3] to use it. Depending on the operating system you may have to https://www.python.org/downloads/[install it].

Having Python 3, you only need to download the latest version of the tool from the official repository, following https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/releases/latest[this link].

Once extracted, you have to run from a shell the main script using Python 3. This may change depending on the operating system.

For example, on Windows, it's usually:

[source,shell]
----
py -3 zx123_tool.py
----

With other operating systems it normally is like:

[source,shell]
----
python3 ./zx123_tool.py
----

You also need a SPI flash image file. This can be obtained from within the Spectrum core in "root" mode, with one of the commands `back16m`, `backzx2` or `backzxd`. Once you have obtained the extracted file from the SD, you can "clean" it leaving only the Spectrum core and the first Spectrum ROM with a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -w -o FLASHempty.ZX1
----

Where `FLASH.ZX1` is the path to the original file and `FLASHempty.ZX1` is the path to the new "clean" file.

<<<

*List the contents of an image*

To see the contents of an image file named `FLASH.ZX1` (installed cores and some configuration info), you can use the command

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -l
----

To show the contents of the same file, including ZX Spectrum ROMs info:

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -l -r
----

*Change the BIOS of an image*

To change the BIOS inside a file named `FLASH.ZX1`, using the BIOS file named `FIRMWARE.ZX1`

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -a BIOS,FIRMWARE.ZX1
----

You can, at the same time, modify some of the default parameters. For example, with the options; `-m` for video mode: 0 (PAL), 1 (NTSC) or 2 (VGA), `-k` for the keyboard layout: 0 (Auto), 1 (ES), 2 (EN) or 3 (Spectrum).

This way to change the BIOS of a file named `FLASH.ZX1`, using the BIOS file `FIRMWARE.ZX1`, and also set the video mode to VGA:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -a BIOS,FIRMWARE.ZX1 -m 2
----

There are also options to set the BIOS boot delay time, the default core or the default Spectrum ROM. See the https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/[documentation] for more info.

<<<

*Add a Spectrum ROM to an image*

To add a Spectrum ROM file named `48.rom`, with the name `Spec48` and using the slot number 5, you can use a command like:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -a ROM,5,xdnlh17,Spec48,48.rom
----

See the https://github.com/kounch/zx123_tool/[documentation] for all the possible options when adding a Spectrum ROM.

Amongst the information you give when adding a ROM, there are some flags used to tell which hardware options, etc, you want to have enabled or disabled when loading the ROM, as shown in this table:

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|`i`
|Keyboard issue 3 enabled (instead of issue 2)
|`c`
|Disable memory contention
|`d`
|Enable DivMMC
|`n`
|Enable NMI DivMMC (esxdos Menu)
|`p`
|Use Pentagon Timings
|`t`
|Use 128K timings
|`s`
|Disable DivMMC and ZXMMC ports
|`m`
|Enable Timex Horizontal MMU
|`h`
|Disable ROM high bit (1FFD bit 2)
|`l`
|Disable ROM low bit (7FFD bit 4)
|`1`
|Disable 1FFD port (+2A/3 paging)
|`7`
|Disable 7FFD port (128K paging)
|`2`
|Disable TurboSound (secondary AY chip)
|`a`
|Disable AY chip
|`r`
|Disable Radastanian mode
|`x`
|Disable Timex mode
|`u`
|Disable ULAPlus

*Install a Core to an image*

For example, to install a core in space 3, from a file named `TBBLUE.ZX1`, with the name `TBBlue`, use a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -a 'CORE,3,TBBlue,TBBLUE.ZX1'
----

If you want also to set the core as the default, use a command like:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -a 'CORE,3,TBBlue,TBBLUE.ZX1' -c 3
----

*Change esxdos ROM of an image*

Just like the BIOS firmware, you can install a ROM esxdos file, with a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
...zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -a esxdos,ESXMMC.BIN
----

*Mix several actions in one line*

Please do note that you can add several actions in one command line. For example, to "clean" an image file named `FLASH.ZX1`, creating a new one named `FLASHnew.ZX1`, installing the BIOS from the file `FIRMWARE.ZX1`, set up video mode to VGA, the keyboard in Spectrum mode, add a Spectrum ROM file `48.rom`, with the name `Spec48` while using slot number 5, install a core at space 3, from a file named `TBBLUE.ZX1`, with the name `TBBlue`, as default core:

[source,shell]
----
... zx123_tool.py -i FLASH.ZX1 -w -o FLASHnew.ZX1 -a BIOS,FIRMWARE.ZX1 -m 2 -k 3 -a ROM,5,xdnlh17,Spec48,48.rom -a CORE,3,TBBlue,TBBLUE.ZX1 -c 3
----

=== Firmware recovery

Sometimes (e.g. when installing an experimental core or when upgrading the ZX Spectrum Core or the BIOS) it may happen that the ZXUNO+ stops booting. The board LEDs are on, but there is no display, and it doesn't do anything when trying the different key combinations to access BIOS setup, etc.

When this happens, there are several recovery methods that let you install again the firmware.

==== JTAG cable connections

Later, in some of the recovery steps, when talking about jump wires or USB-Blaster connections to the ZXUNO+ board, you can use these images as reference.

==== Recovery using a Raspberry Pi

*Hardware required*:

- Raspberry Pi (with SD card, keyboard, display, power supply, etc.) and with internet connection
- 5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_wire[jump wires] (if possible, female on both sides) or, instead a USB-Blaster cable
- One screwdriver for ZXUNO+ cover screws
- SD for ZXUNO+ with the first partition formatted as FAT16 or FAT32
- Keyboard and display for ZXUNO+

*Software required*:

- Flash image and recovery file for ZXUNO+ from https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/tree/master/modflash[Github repository] and https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=774[ZX-Uno forum]

*Instruction Steps*:

. Install Raspberry Pi OS (formerly known as Raspbian) to the Raspberry Pi SD card (using https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/[the official download], https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/[NOOBS], https://github.com/procount/pinn[PINN], etc.)
. Install Open OCD:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git autoconf libtool make pkg-config
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev telnet
sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libftdi-dev
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd-code
cd openocd-code/
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-usb_blaster --enable-sysfsgpio --enable-bcm2835gpio
make
sudo make install
cd ..
rm -rf ./openocd-code
----

<<<

[start=3]
. Connect USB-Blaster or jump wires if using GPIO. In this case, open the ZXUNO+ case and, <<#_jtag_cable_connections,as explained before>> connect the FPGA JTAG lines (`TMS`, `TDI`, `TDO`, `TCK` and `GND`), using the wires, to the Raspberry Pi https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPIO[GPIO] pins.

Is using a GPIO connection, take note of the chosen pins, making sure that `GND` is connected with `GND`.

[.text-center]
image:img/gpio.jpg[scaledwidth=70%]

In this example, the `31`, `33`, `35`, `37` and `39` pins will be used (corresponding to `GPIO #6`, `GPIO #13`, `GPIO #19`, `GPIO #26` and `GND`), like this:

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|ZXUNO+ JTAG
|GPIO
|Raspberry Pi Pin
|`TMS`
|GPIO#6
|`31`
|`TDI`
|GPIO#13
|`33`
|`TDO`
|GPIO#19
|`35`
|`TCK`
|GPIO#26
|`37`
|`GND`
|GND
|`39`
|===

[start=4]
. Copy to the Raspberry Pi the file named `recovery.bit` previously downloaded from the https://www.zxuno.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=774[ZX-Uno forum]. For our example, it will be at `/home/pi/zxunoplus/unbrick/`

. If using GPIO, make a copy of Open OCD configuration file, to the same directory where `recovery.bit` is.

[source,shell]
----
cp /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/raspberrypi2-native.cfg /home/pi/zxunoplus/unbrick/
----

<<<

[start=6]
. For GPIO connection, edit `raspberrypi2-native.cfg` copy, updating `bcm2835gpio_jtag_nums` (uncommenting, if necessary), with your JTAG and GPIO connection numbers, at the line `bcm2835gpio_jtag_nums`. For our example:

[source]
----
# Header pin numbers: 37 31 33 35
bcm2835gpio_jtag_nums 26 6 13 19
----

[start=7]
. Comment, if it wasn't already, the line `bcm2835gpio_swd_nums` (not necessary for USB-Blaster connection):

[source]
----
#bcm2835gpio_swd_nums 11 25
----

[start=8]
. Add, to the end of the file, the line `adapter speed 250` (again, not necessary for USB-Blaster):

[source]
----
adapter speed 250
----

[start=9]
. Turn on the ZXUNO+.

. Make sure that, on the Raspberry Pi, we are in the directory where `recovery.bit` is, and execute the command that loads the BIOS on recovery mode, using the path to the previously edited `raspberrypi2-native.cfg`.

For GPIO connection:

[source,shell]
----
cd /home/pi/zxunoplus/unbrick
sudo openocd -f /home/pi/zxunoplus/unbrick/raspberrypi2-native.cfg -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/cpld/xilinx-xc6s.cfg -c "init; xc6s_program xc6s.tap; pld load 0 recovery.bit ; exit"
----

For USB-Blaster connection:

[source,shell]
----
sudo openocd -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface/altera-usb-blaster.cfg -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/cpld/xilinx-xc6s.cfg -c "init; xc6s_program xc6s.tap; pld load 0 recovery.bit ; exit"
----

<<<

[start=11]
. If all goes well, we will see that the FPGA LED change their state and the BIOS is shown on the display.

If there is no image on the display, press `Scroll Lock` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+G` on +UNO) to switch between RGB and VGA modes, just in case the recovery BIOS did start in the wrong mode for our setup.

[.text-center]
image:img/recovery.png[scaledwidth=70%]

[start=12]
. Insert in the ZXUNO+ the SD card formatted as FAT16 o FAT32, and with the `FLASH.ZX1` file https://github.com/zxdos/zxuno/raw/master/modflash/FLASH.ZX1[downloaded previously].

. If using a USB-Blaster connection, unplug the connector.

[WARNING]
====
This process can't be undone, and it will replace all the previously installed cores, the BIOS, the ZX Spectrum ROMs and their configuration with the data in the image file.
====

[NOTE]
====
Usually, the recovery image is set to use a PS/2 keyboard so, for a +UNO, some key combinations, like `Caps Shift + 5`, etc may not work. In this case, you have to change the keyboard mode to `PC XT`(`Caps Shift + Symbol Shift + U` and then `9`), to make them work temporarily.
====

[start=15]
. After some minutes, the process will end, and, after turning the ZXUNO+ off and on, it should start fine.

[NOTE]
====
If no image is shown, press again `Scroll Lock` (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+G` on +UNO) to switch between RGB and VGA modes. In this case, you should have to enter the BIOS and change <<#_advanced, the right advanced setting>> that matches your display.
====

[NOTE]
====
For a +UNO, since the recovery image uses a PS/2 configuration as default, follow this steps to set up the BIOS correctly:

. If you see no image, switch between RGB and VGA mode (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+G`)
. Change to `PC XT` keyboard mode (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+U` and then `9`)
. Reboot +UNO without losing the temporary keyboard mode (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+B`)
. Quickly, press `Caps Shift + 1`
. Again, if there's no image, switch between RGB and VGA mode (`Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+G`)
. Navigate through BIOS and turn on these options:
- `Advanced` -> `Keyboard Layout`: `Spectrum`
- `Advanced` -> `Video`: `VGA`  (only if there was no image)
. Save changes:
- `Exit` -> `Save changes and exit`
. Completely turn off the +UNO and turn it on again

==== ZX-Uno control I/O registers

In the Spectrum core the `$FC3B` and `$FD3B` ports are reserved and assigned by the https://sinclair.wiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/ZXI_standard[ZXI committee]. A total of 256 different I/O registers unique to the ZX-Uno family are accessed through these ports.

Port `$FC3B` (`64571`) stores the address (`$00` - `$FF`) of the I/O register to be accessed. It can be read to find out which register address was last allocated.

Port `$FD3B` (`64827`) is the access port to the register selected with the previous port. Its meaning (read/write) depends on the implementation of each register.

For example, to allocate bank 16 of the SRAM to the address space `$C000` - `$FFFFFF` during boot mode, using the MASTERMAPPER register, would be as follows:

[source,asm]
----
ld bc,$fc3b     ;Port to set register number to use
ld a,1          ;Register $01 (MASTERMAPPER)
out (c),a       ;Selected. From now on, any access to $FD3B is using MASTERMAPPER
inc b           ;Register access port ($FD3B, just increment B)
ld a,16         ;SRAM Bank 16
out (c),a       ;Write to the MASTERMAPPER register
----

The registers implemented in the ZX-Uno family are described below.

<<<

===== `$00` MASTERCONF

[align="center",options="header"]
|===
|Direction|Value after user reset|Value after master reset|Value after poweron
|Read/Write|Does not change|`00000001`|`00000001`
|===

Binary format (fields in *bold* can only be altered when LOCK=0):
|===
|[.small]#*LOCK*#|[.small]#MODE1#|[.small]#DISCONT#|[.small]#MODE0#|[.small]#I2KB#|[.small]#*DISNMI*#|[.small]#*DIVEN*#|[.small]#*BOOTM*#
|===
* `BOOTM`: 1 indicates that the ZX-Uno is in boot mode (configuration mode). Boot mode only makes sense while the boot firmware is running, where some aspects of the ZX-Uno are allowed to be configured before going into run mode. MASTERCONF can always be read, both in boot mode and in run mode. It is set to 0 manually per program, at which point ZX-Uno enters run mode.
* `DIVEN`: set to 0 indicates that DIVMMC is not enabled in the system, although the SPI interface access ports of the SD/MMC slot are still available. The memory used by DIVMMC remains available for other uses. 1 indicates that DIVMMC is enabled. If enabled, an ESXDOS image must be loaded into the corresponding RAM bank before entering run mode. The default value of this bit is 0.
* `DISNMI`: set to 1 indicates that the DIVMMC NMI function will not be available. NMI will work, but will not cause ESXDOS to automate, thus leaving NMI control to the main system ROM. Bit added to improve DIVMMC compatibility with SE Basic IV. Defaults to 0 (ESXDOS handles NMI events).
* `I2KB`: a1 sets the ULA to return a value consistent with a Spectrum issue 2 when reading the keyboard port ($FE). When 0, the returned value is compatible with issue 3 and later. It defaults to 0.
* `MODE1`,`MODE0`: specifies the ULA timing mode to accommodate different Spectrum models. 00 = ULA ZX Spectrum 48K PAL, 01 = ZX Spectrum 128K/+2 grey, 10 = Pentagon 128, 11 = 48K NTSC (262 scans).
* `DISCONT`: indicates whether memory contention should occur in the video memory. 0 to enable contention (48K and 128K compatibility). 1 to disable contention (Pentagon 128 compatibility).
* `LOCK`: When set to 1, it prevents further changes to certain bits in the MASTERCONF register, and also prevents access to the SPI Flash. This bit is reset to 0 only by a master reset (Ctrl-Alt-BkSpace) or by powering the clone off and on.

===== `$01` MASTERMAPPER

[align="center",options="header"]
|===
|Direction|Value after user reset|Value after master reset|Value after poweron
|Read/Write|Does not change|`00000000`|`00000000`
|===

Only the lower 5 bits (values $00 to $1F) of this register are used. The value stored is the number of a 16KB bank of SRAM that will be paged at addresses $C000-$FFFFFF during boot mode. The values in this register have no effect when the ZX-Uno is in run mode. 32 different values for this register allow addressing up to 512KB of SRAM. If ZX-Uno is expanded with more memory, more bits in this register will be used. The maximum manageable amount of memory is 4MB.

===== `$02` FLASHSPI

[align="center",options="header"]
|===
|Direction|Value after user reset|Value after master reset|Value after poweron
|Read/Write|Does not change|Does not change|`00000000`

Puerto de acceso al registro SPI conectado a la SPI Flash. Escribiendo un valor en este registro, se envÃ­a a la SPI Flash, si Ã©sta estÃ¡ seleccionada. Leyendo un valor de este registro, se lee el Ãºltimo valor enviado por la SPI Flash, y ademÃ¡s, la misma operaciÃ³n de lectura provoca que la SPI envÃ­e un nuevo valor (que serÃ­a leÃ­do con la siguiente operaciÃ³n de lectura a este registro). Por esta razÃ³n, en operaciones de lectura de bloques, el primer byte leÃ­do con este puerto debe descartarse.

|===
|Direction|Value after user reset|Value after master reset|Value after poweron
|Read/Write|Does not change|Does not change|`00000001`

Several bits showing whether or not there is a new key pressed, or released, and whether this is an extended or normal key.
|===
|BSY|0|0|0|ERR|RLS|EXT|PEN
|===

* BSY: Uses 1 when a data transmission to the PS/2 port is still in progress. Wait for a value of 0 to start a new transmission.
* ERR: 1 when the last transmission to or from the PS/2 port had errors.
* RLS: 1 when the last event belongs to a key that has been released.
* EXT: 1 when the last event belongs to a key with extended code (E0+scancode).
* PEN: 1 when there is new data ready to be read in the SCANCODE register. After reading KEYSTAT, this bit is set to 0.

|===
|Direction|Value after user reset|Value after master reset|Value after poweron
|Read/Write|Does not change|Does not change|`00100001`
|===

Bits 0 to 2 show the operating mode of the keyboard mapped joystick (or of the second physical joystick if there is a splitter). Bits 4 to 6 for the operating mode of the physical joystick (DB-9 connector on the side). Bit 3 means autofire of the second joystick or keypad. Bit 7 means autofire of the main joystick. The values are: 000 = Disabled, 001 = Kempston, 010 = Sinclair 1, 011 = Sinclair 2, 100 = Protek/Cursor/AGF, 101 = Fuller, 110 = OPQAspM, 111 = reserved.

===== `$07` KEYMAP

[align="center",options="header"]
|===
|Direction|Value after user reset|Value after master reset|Value after poweron
|Read/Write|Read later|Read later|Read later
|===

On read, each access provides the next byte of the currently loaded ZX-Uno keymap. On write, the byte corresponding to the keymap marked by the current position is modified. In both cases, the address pointer is automatically incremented to point to the next byte of the keymap. This pointer returns to 0 automatically after a reset, a write to the $FC3B register, or when the keymap is terminated. The keymap, in the current implementation, occupies 16384 bytes.

Scandoubler control register and system speed. The following bits are defined:
|===
|TURBO|COPT|FREQ|FREQ|ENSCAN|VGA
|===
* TURBO: 00 to select 3.5 MHz, 01 to select 7 MHz, 10 to select 14 MHz and 11 to select 28 MHz. These bits are also updated with the value of bits D0-D3 of port $8E3B, used in the ZX Prism to select the different speeds for the CPU.
* COPT: selects the way to generate the composite syncs for RGB and composite video: 0 to use the original Spectrum sync type. 1 to use sync pulses according to the PAL standard.
* FREQ: these three bits define the frequency of the master clock, from which all other clocks in the circuit are derived. Among others, the vertical refresh rate is also defined here, which can be used to improve compatibility with some VGA monitors that do not support a vertical refresh rate of 50Hz. The vertical refresh rate values are as follows:
** 000 : 50Hz for 48K and Pentagon mode.
** 001 : 50Hz for 128K mode
** 010 : 52 Hz
** 011 : 53 Hz
** 100 : 55 Hz
** 101 : 57 Hz
** 110 : 59 Hz
** 111 : 60 Hz
* ENSCAN: to 1 to enable the scanline effect in VGA mode. No effect if VGA mode is disabled.
* VGA: set to 1 to enable the scandoubler. The scandoubler output is the same as the normal RGB output, but with a doubling of the horizontal delay frequency. Set to 0 to use 15kHz RGB / composite video output.

===== `$0C` RASTERLINE

|===
|Direction|Value after user reset|Value after master reset|Value after poweron
|Read/Write|`11111111`|`11111111`|`11111111`
|===

Stores the least significant 8 bits of the screen line where maskable interrupt should be triggered. A value of 0 for this register (with LINE8 also equal to 0) sets the raster interrupt to be triggered, if enabled, right at the start of the right edge of the line before the first screen line where the "paper" area begins. In other words: the line count of this interrupt assumes that a screen line is composed of: right edge + horizontal blanking interval + left edge + paper zone. If this assumption is made, the interrupt would be triggered at the beginning of the selected line.
A value for RASTERLINE equal to 192 (with LINE8 equal to 0) triggers the raster interrupt at the beginning of the bottom edge. The line numbers for the end of the bottom edge and start of the top edge depend on the timings used. The highest value possible in practice for RASTERLINE corresponds to a raster interrupt triggered at the last line of the top edge (see RASTERCTRL).

|===

Raster Interrupt Status and Control Register. The following bits are defined.
|===
|INT|0|0|0|0|0|DISVINT|ENARINT|LINE8
|===
* INT: this bit is only available on read. It is set to 1 for 32 clock cycles from the time the raster interrupt is triggered. This bit is available even if the processor has interrupts disabled. It is not available if the ENARINT bit is set to 0.
* DISVINT: set to 1 to disable the vertical retrace maskable interrupts (the original ULA interrupts). After a reset, this bit is set to 0.
* ENARINT: set to 1 to enable raster line maskable interrupts. After a reset, this bit is set to 0.
* LINE8: saves bit 8 of the RASTERLINE value, so that any value between 0 and 511 can be set, although in practice, the largest value is limited by the number of lines generated by the ULA (311 in 48K mode, 310 in 128K mode, 319 in Pentagon mode). If a line number higher than the limit is set, the raster interrupt will not occur.

===== `$0E` DEVCONTROL

[align="center",options="header"]
|===
|Direction|Value after user reset|Value after master reset|Value after poweron
|Read/Write|Does not change|`00000000`|`00000000`
|===

Enable/disable register for different features. The following bits are defined.
|===
|DISD|ENMMU|DIROMSEL1F|DIROMSEL7F|DI1FFD|DI7FFD|DI7FFD|DITAY|DIAY
|===
* DISD: Set to 1 to disable the SPI hardware interface for SD (used in DivMMC and ZXMMC). Disabling this interface frees ports $1F on write, $3F, $E7 and $EB. After master reset, it is set to 0.
* ENMMU: set to 1 to enable the horizontal MMU used on the Timex Sinclair. Enabling this interface uses bit 7 of port $FF, port $F4 is used and a read to port $FF returns the last value written to it. After master reset, it is 0.
* DIROM1F: the value of this bit is masked with the value of bit 2 of port $1FFD according to the operation ~DIROM1F & $1FFD[2]. The net result is that if this bit is set to 1, the system will work as if the value of bit 2 of port $1FFD is always 0, regardless of the value written to it. After master reset, it is set to 0, which allows changes to bit 2 of $1FFD to be taken into account.
* DIROM7F: the value of this bit is masked with the value of bit 4 of port $7FFD according to the operation ~DIROM7F & $7FFD[4]. The net result is that if this bit is set to 1, the system will work as if the value of bit 4 of port $7FFD is always 0, regardless of the value written to it. After master reset, it is set to 0, which allows changes to bit 4 of $7FFD to be taken into account.
* DI1FFD: set to 1 to disable the +2A/+3 compatible paging system. Disabling this interface frees the $1FFD port on write. Note that the decoding of port $7FFD, if active, is different depending on whether port $1FFD is active or not.
* DI7FFD: to 1 to disable the 128K compatible paging system. Disabling this system disables the +2A/+3 paging system even if it is not explicitly disabled.
* DITAY: set to 1 to disable the second AY chip, thus disabling Turbo Sound mode.
* DIAY: set to 1 to disable the main AY chip. Disabling this chip disables the second AY chip, even if it is not explicitly disabled.

|Enable/disable register of different features (continuation of DEVCONTROL). The following bits are defined.
|===
|Resv|Resv|SPLITTER|DIMIXER|DISPECDRUM|DIRADES|DITIMEX|DIULAPLUS
|===
* Resv: This bit is reserved. In the current implementation, a 0 must be written to it if the register value is updated.
* SPLITTER: set to 1 to enable joystick splitter.
* DIMIXER: set to 1 to disable sound output.
* DISPECDRUM: set to 1 to disable SpecDrum/Covox support.
* DIRADAS: set to 1 to disable radastanian mode. Note that if radastanian mode is not disabled, but ULAplus is disabled, when attempting to use radastanian mode, the datapath used in the ULA will not be as expected and the display behaviour in this case is not documented.
* DITIMEX: to 1 to disable Timex compatible display modes. Any writes to the $FF port are therefore ignored. If the Timex MMU is enabled, a read to port $FF will return 0.
* DIULAPLUS: set to 1 to disable the ULAplus. Any writes to the ULAplus ports are ignored. Reads to those ports return the value of the floating bus. Note however that the contention mechanism for this port still works even if it is disabled.

Contains the number of bytes to be added to the base address of the screen (4000h, 6000h, C000h or E000h depending on the configuration) to obtain the address where the first two pixels are located in Radastanian mode. It is a 14-bit register. To write a value, the 8 least significant bits are written first, followed immediately by the 8 most significant bits (the 2 most significant bits of this value are ignored).
If the offset value is such that scanning the screen memory to create the image reaches the end of a 16KB page, scanning will continue at the beginning of that same page.

Contains the number of bytes - 64 that a scanline occupies in Radastanian mode. That is, if this register is 0, the length in bytes of a scanline is 64 bytes (128 pixels). If this register is 4, the length of a scanline is 68 bytes (136 pixels). If it is 255, the length of a scanline is 64+255=319 bytes, or 638 pixels.
If the offset value is such that scanning the screen memory to create the image reaches the end of a 16KB page, scanning will continue at the beginning of that same page.

This pointer returns to 0 automatically after a reset or a write to the `$FC3B` register. The delivered characters that are part of the string are standard printable ASCII (codes `32`-`127`). Any other value indicates that this register is not operational.
